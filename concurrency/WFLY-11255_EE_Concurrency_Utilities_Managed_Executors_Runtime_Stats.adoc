== Overview

The managed executors / thread pools in the EE subsytem currently do not show any runtime information stats when invoked with include-runtime=true, and such would be useful to check the performance and tuning.

== Requirements

* Add the following runtime read-only attributes to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/17.0/subsystem/ee/managed-executor-service/[/subsystem=ee/managed-executor-service resource], to obtain runtime stats:
* *active-thread-count*: the approximate number of threads that are actively executing tasks.
* *completed-task-count*: the approximate total number of tasks that have completed execution.
* *current-queue-size*: the current size of the executor's task queue.
* *hung-thread-count*: the number of executor threads that are hung.
* *max-thread-count*: the largest number of executor threads.
* *task-count*: the approximate total number of tasks that have ever been submitted for execution.
* *thread-count*: the current number of executor threads.

* Add the following runtime read-only attributes to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/17.0/subsystem/ee/managed-scheduled-executor-service/[/subsystem=ee/managed-scheduled-executor-service resource] to obtain runtime stats:
* *active-thread-count*: the approximate number of threads that are actively executing tasks.
* *completed-task-count*: the approximate total number of tasks that have completed execution.
* *current-queue-size*: the current size of the executor's task queue.
* *hung-thread-count*: the number of executor threads that are hung.
* *max-thread-count*: the largest number of executor threads.
* *task-count*: the approximate total number of tasks that have ever been submitted for execution.
* *thread-count*: the current number of executor threads.

=== Hard Requirements

* NONE

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

A Performance and Tuning Guide section, with respect to usage of managed executor runtime stats, would be helpful for users.

=== Non-Requirements

* Domain mode: the new attributes discussed in this proposal will be provided on the servers in a managed domain, but will not be registered with the /profile=*/subsystem=ee resources.

== Test Plan

* Changes in Wildfly management model will be covered in WFLY testsuite.
* Checking the new featured functionality work as expected will be covered in WFLY testsuite.

== Community Documentation

* Covered by attribute description in management model.
