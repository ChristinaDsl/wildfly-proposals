== Overview

The managed executors in the EE subsystem are capable of identifying tasks which are running for a long unexpected time, also know as hung tasks, and this proposal specifies new functionality that will allows users to manually and automatically terminate such tasks.

=== Hard Requirements

* Add the following attribute to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/18.0/subsystem/ee/managed-executor-service/[/subsystem=ee/managed-executor-service resource]:
** *hung-task-termination-period*: the period, in milliseconds, for hung tasks automatic termination. A value of 0, which is the default, deactivates the feature.

CLI to read the attribute from the Managed Executor Service resource named *default*:
----
/subsystem=ee/managed-executor-service=default:read-attribute(name=hung-task-termination-period)
----

* Add the following operation to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/18.0/subsystem/ee/managed-executor-service/[/subsystem=ee/managed-executor-service resource]:
** *terminate-hung-tasks*: manually terminates all executor tasks that are hung.

CLI to execute the operation from the Managed Executor Service resource named *default*:
----
/subsystem=ee/managed-executor-service=default:terminate-hung-tasks()
----

* Add the following attribute to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/18.0/subsystem/ee/managed-scheduled-executor-service/[/subsystem=ee/managed-scheduled-executor-service resource]:
** *hung-task-termination-period*: the period, in milliseconds, for hung tasks automatic termination. A value of 0, which is the default, deactivates the feature.

CLI to read the attribute from the Managed Scheduled Executor Service resource named *default*:
----
/subsystem=ee/managed-scheduled-executor-service=default:read-attribute(name=hung-task-termination-period)
----

* Add the following operation to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/18.0/subsystem/ee/managed-scheduled-executor-service/[/subsystem=ee/managed-scheduled-executor-service resource]:
** *terminate-hung-tasks()*: manually terminates all executor tasks that are hung.

CLI to execute the operation from the Managed Scheduled Executor Service resource named *default*:
----
/subsystem=ee/managed-scheduled-executor-service=default:terminate-hung-tasks()

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* NONE

=== Non-Requirements

* Domain mode:
** the new attribute discussed in this proposal will be provided on the servers in a managed domain, and registered with the /profile=*/subsystem=ee resources, being automatically discarded for servers which do not support it.
** the new operation discussed in this proposal will be provided on the servers in a managed domain, and registered only with the /host=*/server=*/subsystem=ee resources.

== Test Plan

* Changes in Wildfly management model will be covered in WFLY testsuite.
* Checking the new featured functionality work as expected will be covered in WFLY testsuite.

== Community Documentation

* Covered by local descriptions in management model.
