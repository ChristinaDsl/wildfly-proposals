== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

The following table shows the new requirements vs the existing behavior in ejb3 subsystem thread-pool:


|===
|New Requirement |Existing Behavior of EJB3 Subsystem thread-pool

|Ability to configure core-threads and max-threads independently
|max-threads is configurable, but core-threads is not configurable and always equals to max-threads

|Ability to reuse available threads as much as possible, without unnecessary creation of new threads
|Upon new request, new threads are created up to the limit of max-threads, even though idle threads are available

|Ability to timeout idle non-core threads after keepalive-timeout
|Idle threads are not timed out, and keepalive-timeout is ignored

|Ability to create and use non-core threads after core threads are saturated
|Income tasks are queued after core threads are used up
|===


=== New elements in wildfly-ejb3_6_0.xsd schema

Need to add a new sub-element under thread-pool element:

[source]
<xs:element name="core-threads" type="threads:countType"/>

=== Expected CLI Operations and resources

[source]
/subsystem=ejb3/thread-pool=default:read-resource
{
"outcome" => "success",
"result" => {
  "core-threads" => 2,
  "keepalive-time" => {
    "time" => 1000L,
    "unit" => "SECONDS"
  },
  "max-threads" => 10,
  "name" => "default",
  "thread-factory" => undefined
}
}

[source]

/subsystem=ejb3/thread-pool=default:write-attribute(name=core-threads, value=3)
{"outcome" => "success"}

[source]

/subsystem=ejb3/thread-pool=default:read-attribute(name=core-threads)
{
"outcome" => "success",
"result" => 3
}

[source]

/subsystem=ejb3/thread-pool=default:write-attribute(name=max-threads, value=9)
{"outcome" => "success"}

[source]

/subsystem=ejb3/thread-pool=default:read-attribute(name=max-threads)
{
"outcome" => "success",
"result" => 9
}

[source]

/subsystem=ejb3/thread-pool=default:read-resource(include-runtime=true)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => {
        "active-count" => 0,
        "completed-task-count" => 242L,
        "core-threads" => 1,
        "current-thread-count" => 1,
        "keepalive-time" => {
            "time" => 1000L,
            "unit" => "MILLISECONDS"
        },
        "largest-thread-count" => 2,
        "max-threads" => 10,
        "name" => "default",
        "queue-size" => 0,
        "rejected-count" => 0,
        "task-count" => 228L,
        "thread-factory" => undefined
    }
}

=== New attribute in ejb3 subsystem resource model

Need to add a new attribute to ejb3 subsystem resource model to represent core-threads configuration, as a peer
to the existing max-threads attribute.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* ability to switch between the existing thread-pool and the new thread-pool backed by `EnhancedQueueExecutor`

=== Non-Requirements

* improvement of thread-pool configuration in subsystems other than ejb3
* ability to configure ejb3 thread-pool queue size
* ability to allow ejb3 thread-pool core threads to timeout
* improvement to thread-factory configuration in ejb3 subsystem thread-pool
* configuration in ejb3 subsystem of advanced features in `EnhancedQueueExecutor`, e.g., growth resistance factor.


== Implementation Plan
////
Delete if not needed. The intent is if you have a complex feature which can 
not be delivered all in one go to suggest the strategy. If your feature falls 
into this category, please mention the Release Coordinators on the pull 
request so they are aware.
////

* switch ejb3 subsystem thread-pool to the thread-pool backed by `org.jboss.threads.EnhancedQueueExecutor`
* need to modify wildfly-core threads sub-project
** add to wildfly-core threads sub-project `EnhancedQueueExecutorService`, which is backed by `org.jboss.threads.EnhancedQueueExecutor`
** add related classes to support the new `EnhancedQueueExecutorService`, such as `EnhancedQueueExecutorAdd`, `EnhancedQueueExecutorRemove`,
`EnhancedQueueExecutorResourceDefinition`, `EnhancedQueueExecutorWriteAttributeHandler`, etc

== Test Plan

* Some of the basic testing outline:
** verify basic CRUD operations of the new attribute in ejb3 subsystem resource model (see CLI operations above)
** transformer tests
** behavior tests:
*** verify core-threads and max-threads can be configured independently to different values
*** verify core-threads are re-used, if available, and no new core threads are created unnecessarily
**** by using @Schedule ejb timers, or async ejb invocations
*** verify number of core threads are kept at a relative low number after certain number of operations, such as ejb timer or async ejb invocations.

For example, to verify core thread reuse, configure core-threads = 1, deploy the following singleton ejb that
contains an auto timer that expires in every second. The single core thread should be able to service all timeout
calls and no other threads should be created.

[source]

@Startup
@Singleton
public class ScheduleSingleton {
    private final ConcurrentSkipListSet<String> threadNames = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<String>();

    @Schedule(second="*/1", minute="*", hour="*", persistent=false)
    public void timeout(Timer t) {
        threadNames.add(Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    public Set<String> getThreadNames() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableSet(threadNames);
    }
}

After sleeping a while, the test servlet can call `getThreadNames()` to verify that it only contains 1 element, e.g.,
`[EJB default - 1]`


To verify non-core thread timeout, configure ejb thread-pool timeout to be a short one, add another similar timeout
method to `ScheduleSingleton` so 2 timers will fire at every second and at least one non-core threads will be created.
As non-core threads time out, new non-core threads will be created to service timeout calls.  So the output will be like:

[source]

EJB default - 1, EJB default - 10, EJB default - 11, EJB default - 12, EJB default - 13, EJB default - 14, EJB default - 2, EJB default - 3, EJB default - 4, EJB default - 5, EJB default - 6, EJB default - 7, EJB default - 8, EJB default - 9

== Community Documentation

Enhance WildFly community docs (docs/src/main/asciidoc/_admin-guide/subsystem-configuration/EJB3.adoc) to describe
the new attribute `core-threads` and affected changes. `EJB3.adoc` has been updated and included in the PR to WildFly.
