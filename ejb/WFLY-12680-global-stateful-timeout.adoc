== Requirements

The standard way to configure stateful bean session timeout for each ejb is via `@StatefulTimeout` annotation,
or `stateful-timeout` in ejb-jar.xml.  But WildFly currently (version 18) lacks the ability to configure a default
global stateful bean session timeout for all deployed stateful beans.  This feature is useful to deploy and
configure multiple stateful beans consistently in a server instance or cluster.

=== Hard Requirements

* Users should be able to configure default global stateful timeout in server config file for all deployed stateful session beans.
** If this configuration is absent, the current behavior should be preserved (i.e., stateful session beans do not timeout unless explicitly removed by application)
** add this configuration via CLI
** remove this configuration via CLI
** update this configuration to a new value via CLI
** read this configuration value via CLI
* `@StatefulTimeout` annotation in bean class should override this default global stateful timeout in server config file
* `stateful-timeout` in ejb-jar.xml should override this default global stateful timeout in server config file
* when neither `@StatefulTimeout` nor `stateful-timeout` is present, the configured `default-stateful-bean-session-timeout`
should take effect.


=== Expected CLI Operations and resources

[source]
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=ejb3:read-attribute(name=default-stateful-bean-session-timeout)
{
"outcome" => "success",
"result" => -1
}
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=ejb3:write-attribute(name=default-stateful-bean-session-timeout, value=6000)
{"outcome" => "success"}

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* None

=== Non-Requirements

* ability to configure default global stateful timeout in WildFly admin console
* ability to specify default global stateful timeout in custom time unit
* ability to immediately apply the updated default global stateful timeout value to deployed stateful beans


== Implementation Plan
////
Delete if not needed. The intent is if you have a complex feature which can 
not be delivered all in one go to suggest the strategy. If your feature falls 
into this category, please mention the Release Coordinators on the pull 
request so they are aware.
////

* add a new attribute, `default-session-timeout` to ejb3 subsystem schema, for example,

[source]
<xs:complexType name="stateful-beanType">
    ...
    <xs:attribute name="default-session-timeout" type="xs:integer" default="-1" use="optional">
        <xs:annotation>
            <xs:documentation>
                The default session timeout, for stateful session beans, in milliseconds
            </xs:documentation>
        </xs:annotation>
    </xs:attribute>

[source]

<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:ejb3:7.0">
<session-bean>
    <stateless>
        <bean-instance-pool-ref pool-name="slsb-strict-max-pool"/>
    </stateless>
    <!-- add new attribute default-session-timeout -->
    <stateful default-session-timeout="600000"
      default-access-timeout="5000" cache-ref="simple" passivation-disabled-cache-ref="simple"/>
    <singleton default-access-timeout="5000"/>
    ...
</session-bean>

* This new configuration will appear as a new attribute (`default-stateful-bean-session-timeout`) under ejb3 subsystem resource:

[source]
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=ejb3:read-resource
{
"outcome" => "success",
"result" => {
    ...
    "default-stateful-bean-session-timeout" => -1,
    ...
}

== Test Plan

New tests will be added to `wildfly/testsuite/integration/basic/src/test/java/org/jboss/as/test/integration/ejb/stateful/timeout`,
and existing test case in that directory will be enhanced to verify the new feature.

* structural tests with CLI CRUD operations of the new attribute `default-stateful-bean-session-timeout`
** write attribute `default-stateful-bean-session-timeout` to `-1`, `0`, and `1000`, and then read and verify the attribute value
** rewrite the attribute to some other value, and then read and verify the updated attribute value
* behavioral tests of default stateful session timeout
** when this attribute is absent in server config file, a stateful session bean should not timeout and be removed.  This is the existing behavior before this RFE is implemented.
** when this attribute is set to a certain value, a stateful session bean should timeout and subject to removal after this duration (there could be some delay between timeout and actual removal)
** `@StatefulTimeout` annotation in bean class should override this attribute in server config file
** `stateful-timeout` in `ejb-jar.xml` should override this attribute in server config file
* transformer tests should be added to `Ejb3TransformersTestCase`

== Community Documentation

Enhance WildFly community docs (docs/src/main/asciidoc/_admin-guide/subsystem-configuration/EJB3.adoc) to describe
the new attribute `default-stateful-bean-session-timeout` and affected changes.
