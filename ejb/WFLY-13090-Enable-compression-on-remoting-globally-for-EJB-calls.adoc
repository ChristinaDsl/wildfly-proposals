== Introduction

EJB client protocol already allows for compression of invocation message and open-session message payload. Currently compression is configured inside the application code by annotating classes with org.jboss.ejb.client.annotation.CompressionHint. A sample configuration may be as follows:
[source]
----
public class Foo {
    @CompressionHint(compressRequest = true, compressResponse = true, compressionLevel = 5)
    void foo();
}
----
[source]

The configuration above is provided per-bean basis and currently there is no possibility to configure compression globally. Providing such configuration is the goal of this RFE.

== Proposed solution

Users would be allowed to provide default compression on the client side. This compression level would be used for both request and response compression. Default compression can be mixed with @CompressionHint configuration. Per-bean @CompressionHint configuration has the higher priority.

=== Standalone client configuration

Users would be able to specify default compression by providing default.compression property to jboss-ejb-client.properties file. Sample configuration would be as follows:
[source]
----
remote.connections=default

remote.connection.default.host=${node0:localhost}
remote.connection.default.port=8080

default.compression=5
----
[source]

=== Server configuration
Users would be able to specify default compression by setting default-compression property in jboss-ejb-client.xml descriptor file inside the deployment. Sample file would look as follows:
[source]
----
<jboss-ejb-client xmlns="urn:jboss:ejb-client:1.4">
    <client-context default-compression="5">
        <profile name="test-profile" />
    </client-context>
</jboss-ejb-client>
----
[source]

As a result of the above change we would have to upgrade the version of the schema.

== Draft implementation
