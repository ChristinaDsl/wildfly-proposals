== Overview

Since Apache Artemis 2.16 the JDBC Jjournal has been updated to properly use a connection poool. This proposal is to take that change into account and look into the consequences form WildFly integration point of view.

== Requirements

With Apache Artemis 2.16, proper support for a JDBC pool was introduced. While apache Artemis uses https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/configuration.html[Apache Commons DBCP], it allows a better support for other pools too.
This change requires to provide proper configuration of the Ironjacamar Datasource for good perfomance. Thus we need to document this in our community doc.
Take into account https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/pull/3204#issuecomment-696183450[this comment on the PR].

=== Hard Requirements

WildFly was already providing a connection pool to Artemis but now we need to ensure that it is still working properly with our test suite, eventually reconfiguring the pool to match the tests behaviour.
We need to check that this new behaviour from Artemis doesn't introduce regression.
We also need to provide an up to date documentation to help our users with the configuration of this pool.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

N/A

=== Non-Requirements

N/A

== Test Plan

Reuse the existing test suite

== Community Documentation
The feature will be documented in WildFly Admin Guide (in the Messaging Configuration section).
