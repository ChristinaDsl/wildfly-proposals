== Overview
When connecting to a remote broker the prefixes used for Artemis 1.5.x compatibility might not be required nor used. While this can be set for a pure client, in WildFly you can't set it for the connection factory you are using. This feature aims to fix that by enabling to configure this at the connection factory level.

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ENTESB-10484[ENTESB-10484]
Fuse is connecting to a remote broker 2.6.x  where the topic is created by the broker itself without the prefix.
They access this topic through a Wildfly connection factory which will append the compatibility prefix thus making the resolution of the topic name fail.

== Requirements

* Add a `enable-amq1-prefix`  boolean attribute to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/16.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/connection-factory/[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/connection-factory resource] to control the enablement of Artemis 1.x prefix. Default is `true` (meaning that name retro-compatibility is enabled).

== Test Plan

Create a core queue on a remote broker without the prefixes and connect to it disabling the enable1Prefixes on the pooled-connection-factory to access it by its name.

The feature will be documented in WildFly Admin Guide (in the Messaging Configuration section).
