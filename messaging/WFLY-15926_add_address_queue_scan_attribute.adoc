== Overview

Apache Artemis now deletes queues in an asynchronous way using a scheduled thread. Being able to define the frequency at which queues marked to be deleted are effectively deleted is something we need to be able to configure.
So we are adding a new `address_queue_scan` attribute to be able to set the period between each deletion process.

=== Other Interested Projects

== Requirements

Add a new `address_queue_scan`attribute to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/26.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server resource] to define the scan periodicity.

=== Hard Requirements

Create the attribute to be able to configure the Artemis broker.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Implementation Plan

* Add a positive LONG `address_queue_scan` attribute, with a default value set to `30000` in milliseconds. It is not required.

This attribute will be added to the https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/26.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server resource]

== Test Plan

* Changes in Wildfly management model will be covered in WF testsuite.

== Community Documentation

* Covered by attribute description in management model.
