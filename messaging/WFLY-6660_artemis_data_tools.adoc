== Overview

For debugging and investigation purposes it would useful to have a WildFly management API operation which would dump content of Artemis journal directory.
This new operation would print content of journal to a file. It would take advantage of https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/data-tools.html[Artemis data tools print command].

== Requirements

The new operation 'data-print' will added  to the https://docs.wildfly.org/22/wildscribe/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/[/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server resource]. It will print a report about journal records and summary of existent records, as well a report on paging. This operation shouldn't be executed against a running broker.

=== Hard Requirements

Provide a new 'data-print' operation that will return a stream (that can be saved to a file) with the following parameters:
 * secret a Boolean parameter with a default value of 'false' to print the data structure without showing the your data.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

 Add an `archive` Boolean parameter to return a zip of the journal dump instead of the plain text report to reduce network usage.

=== Non-Requirements

This operation will only work on the embedded borker and is not by any mean a way to get data from another Artemis installation (standalone or embeded) using the configuration of the broker it is run against.
Support for JDBC journal is not a requirement as there is no JDBC connection available on admin-mode.

== Implementation Plan

Provide a new RuntimeOnlyHandler that will execute only in `admin-mode`. It will work in the 'same' way as the `org.wildfly.extension.messaging.activemq.ExportJournalOperation` to invoke the Artemis command: ` org.apache.activemq.artemis.cli.commands.tools.PrintData`.
It will reuse the configuration from the embedded broker to find the `bindings`, `messages` and `paging` directories.

CLI to read the report:
----
attachment display --operation=/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=default:print-data()
----

CLI to download a zipped version of the report:
----
attachment save --file=/home/ehsavoie/tmp/test.zip --operation=/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=default:print-data(archive=true)
----

== Test Plan
Create a simple test class `org.jboss.as.test.integration.messaging.mgmt.PrintDataTestCase` with two test :

* testPrintFullData:
    - send a message to a queue, 
    - restart in admin-mode
    - dump the journal 
    - check that it displays the queue, the correct number of total messages and the correct number of message in the queue.
* testPrintSafeData:
    - send a message to a queue
    - restart in admin-mode
    - dump the journal in secret mode 
    - check that it displays the correct number of total messages and the correct number of message in the queue but doesn't display the queue infos.


== Community Documentation

The feature will be documented in WildFly Admin Guide (in the Messaging Configuration section).

== Release Note Content

Adding an operation to be able to get  a dump of the embedded Artemis journal for investigation purpose.
