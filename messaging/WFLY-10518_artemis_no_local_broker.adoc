== Overview

Connections to remote Artemis-based broker (including A-MQ 7) are handled in
WildFly by the
https://wildscribe.github.io/WildFly/13.0/subsystem/messaging-activemq/server/pooled-connection-factory/index.html[pooled-connection-factory]
resource that is in the `messaging-activemq`.

This `pooled-connection-factory` resource can be used to connect to the local Artemis server that "owns" it or to a remote Artemis broker.

However, this `pooled-connection-factory` resource always require the presence of a local Artemis server even when it connects only to a remote Artemis broker.
This use case will become more prevalent as WildFly is deployed on OpenShift to connect to a remote A-MQ 7 broker.

The presence of a local Artemis server has impact on the memory and CPU  footprint of WildFly image on OpenShift but also on a bare metal installation.
This RFE will improve WildFly so that a connection to a remote Artemis-based
 broker will no longer require the presence of a local instance of Artemis.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-10518[WFLY-10518]

=== Related Issues

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EAP7-1014[EAP7-1014]
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EAP7-1006[EAP7-1006] is a RFE related to Java EE7 JMS resource
definitions that will benefit from this RFE.

=== Affected Projects or Components

* This is a internal restructuring of the `messaging-activemq` subsystem that requires no changes
from Artemis or other messaging components. Existing code will still be working if a local broker is present thus no migration operation is required.

=== Other Interested Projects

== Requirements

* It must be possible to configure WildFly to connect to a remote Artemis-based broker (using the Artemis resource adapter)
  without having to run a local Artemis broker in WildFly.
* Previous and current subsystem schemas and models must remain compatible.
* JavaEE 7 JMS definition annotations are out of the scope of this RFE.
* Connecting standalone JMS clients to obtain a connection to a remote AMQ7 broker is *NOT SUPPORTED* at this stage.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Refactor the Artemis modules to have a proper split between Artemis client and server code.
* The Artemis resource adapter should only need to depend on Artemis client module.

== Proposed Design

Create new resources into `/subsystem=messaging/`:

  * `connector`, `http-connector`, `remote-connector`, `in-vm-connector`
  * `discovery-group`
  * `pooled-connection-factory`
  * `connection-factory`

Note that they may differ from those for a `server`. The new resources are only **visible** in their context. Thus a subsystem connector can't be referenced from a server pooled connection factory. In a similar way, resources in a server can't be referenced from a subsystem resource.

Other resources that remains in `/subsystem=messaging/server`:

  * `acceptor`, `http-acceptor`, `remote-acceptor`, `in-vm-acceptor` (they corresponds to Artemis broker configuration)
  * `broadcast-group` (this kind of resource is only used by Artemis brokers to broadcast cluster information)

=== JMS Destination resources

With the proposed design, a `pooled-connection-factory` resource is able to connect to a
remote Artemis broker.
However, to provide a fully functional JMS application, the user also needs to inject (or
  lookup in JNDI) JMS Destinations object that represents the queue or topic managed by the remote
  broker.

There are `jms-queue` and `jms-topic` resources under the `server` resources but they require
broker code to create and configure the queue on the local Artemis broker.

We need another type of resources that represents JMS Destination object to store in JNDI.

These new resources will be under `/subsystem=messaging-activemq`:

  * `external-jms-queue`
  * `external-jms-topic`

These resources have a single attribute:

  * `jndi-name` - the JNDI binding to store the Destination object

The name of these resources are meaningful: it *MUST* be identical to the name of the destinations configured
    in the remote Artemis broker

These resources have *no* runtime management operations (e.g. to flush messages, etc.). They are just local
representation of remote Artemis resources and does not allow to manage the remote resources in any capacity.
They are named `external-` as they are meant to be used by client application (either in a deployment or a
  remote client) to an external broker. They are the _client_ representation of an external JMS destination.

== Examples

=== WildFly Configuration to connect to a remote Artemis broker

[source,xml]
----
<subsystem name="messaging-activemq">
  <remote-connector name="remote"
                    socket-binding="remote-messaging"/>
  <pooled-connection-factory name="remote-artemis"
    entries="java:/jms/remote/myCF"
    connectors="remote" />
  <!-- the Artemis Broker has defined a JMS Queue named `myQueue` -->
  <external-jms-queue="myQueue" jndi-name="java:/jms/remote/myQueue" />
</subsystem>
----

=== Java Code to send and receive messages from the remote broker

[source,java]
----
@Resource(lookup"=java:/jms/remote/myQueue")
Queue myQueue;

@Inject
@JMSConnectionFactory("java:/jms/remote/myCF")
private JMSContext context;
----

=== Message-Driven Bean activation

[source,java]
----
@MessageDriven(
        name = "MyMDB",
        activationConfig = {
                @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationType", propertyValue = "javax.jms.Queue"),
                @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationLookup", propertyValue = "java:/jms/remote/myQueue")
        }
)
@ResourceAdapter("remote-artemis") // name of the pooled-connection-factory resource
public class MyMDB implements MessageListener {
  public void onMessage(final Message m) {
    ...
  }
}

== Test Plan

== Community Documentation

The feature will be documented in WildFly Admin Guide (in the Messaging Configuration section).
