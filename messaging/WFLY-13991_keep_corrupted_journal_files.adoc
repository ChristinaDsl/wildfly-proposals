== Overview


When a corrupted artemis journal file is seen Artemis shuts down WildFLy, but before it does that it deletes the corrupted file. This means that no after the event analysis/investigation can be done as the corrupted journal file is gone.

== Requirements

* The journalMaxAtticFiles parameter of ActiveMQ Artemis configuration must be configurable via WildFly management model.

== Implementation Plan

The `journal-max-attic-files` attribute of type INT with a default value of '10' will be added to messaging server resource.
This defines the number of files that will be kept if there is an error. If a value of `0` is set then no file will be kept. +
The files will be stored under the *journal* folder in *$WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/data/activemq/journal/* by default.

CLI to set the attribute:

----
/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=default:write-attribute(name=journal-max-attic-files, value=10)
----

== Test Plan

* The functionality of the journalMaxAtticFiles attribute on Artemis side is covered by
https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/commit/fdfc581/

* Changes in Wildfly management model will be covered in WF testsuite.

== Community Documentation

* Covered by attribute description in management model.
