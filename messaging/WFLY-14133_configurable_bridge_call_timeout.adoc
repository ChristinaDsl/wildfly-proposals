== Overview

The Artemis broker defines a call-timeout attribute on the core bridge, which sets a time out for blocking calls to the
server. Unless modified, the call-timeout defaults to 30 seconds (this is the default value defined in Artemis).
It is possible to programmatically modify this timeout by a lower level Artemis API, but it is not currently possible
to modify with the high level API that Wildfly currently uses to create core bridges. It is currently not possible at all to
modify this attribute by a Wildfly administrator.

It was requested to make this attribute configurable via the Wildfly management model.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Make the `BridgeConfiguration#callTimeout` attribute configurable via the Wildfly management model.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

None.

=== Non-Requirements

None.

== Implementation Plan

=== Relevant Entities

* `ActiveMQServerControl` is a part of the high level Artemis API used to control the embedded Artemis broker.
* `ActiveMQServer` is part of a lower level Artemis API used to control the embedded Artemis broker.
* `BridgeDefinition` is a Wildfly management model resource definition class describing the Artemis core bridge.
* `BridgeAdd` is a Wildfly controller handler used to create the Artemis core bridges.

=== Code Changes

1. Add the `call-timeout` attribute to the `BridgeDefinition` class in the messaging-activemq subsystem.
This also requires creating new schema version of the messaging management model (version 13).
+
Attribute is of type long, unit is milliseconds, and its' default value is 30000 ms. The default value is defined in the Artemis code base
(`this.callTimeout = 30000L;` in `BridgeDefinition` constructor) as well as in the Wildfly management model definition
of the attribute.

2. Modify the `BridgeAdd` class so that the `BridgeDefinition#call-timeout` management model value is propagated to the
code responsible for creating the bridge. Currently, the attribute values are passed
to the `ActiveMQServerControl#createBridge()` method (part of Artemis API). There are several variants of this method,
none of these however accepts the `call-timeout` attribute. Because of that, bridges needs to be created with a lower
level API by calling `ActiveMQServer#deployBridge()` (rather than `ActiveMQServerControl#createBridge()`).

=== Future Plans

New variant of the `ActiveMQServerControl#createBridge()` method is being prepared in Artemis 2.17, which would accept
a single String parameter, which would be a JSON string representation of a `BridgeConfiguration` instance.
This new method should become the preferred variant,
the other variants will be deprecated.

When Artemis 2.17 will be pulled into Wildfly, the `BridgeAdd` handler should be modified to use the new JSON string
method variant, which will simplify the code.

This change will be tracked by a separate RFE.

== Test Plan

* Verify changes in Wildfly management model:
** verify that `call-timeout` value is read from XML configuration file,
** verify that the attribute is rejected when transforming to older schema version.
* Verify that the `BridgeAdd` handler propagates the `call-timeout` value to the Artemis API
(`ActiveMQServer.deployBridge()` or `ActiveMQServerControl.deployBridge()`)
* Provide an integration test which would create a bridge and verify the bridge is functional.

== Community Documentation

* Attribute description in the Wildfly management model:
"A blocking call timeout for this bridge."

Otherwise no community documentation is needed.

Generally a feature should have documentation as part of the PR to wildfly master, or as a follow up PR if the feature is in wildfly-core. In some cases though the documentation belongs more in a component, or does not need any documentation. Indicate which of these will happen.

== Release Note Content

Added the call-timeout attribute on JMS core bridge. The attribute specifies time out on blocking calls performed
by a core bridge.

////
Draft verbiage for up to a few sentences on the feature for inclusion in the
Release Note blog article for the release that first includes this feature.
Example article: http://wildfly.org/news/2018/08/30/WildFly14-Final-Released/.
This content will be edited, so there is no need to make it perfect or discuss
what release it appears in.  "See Overview" is acceptable if the overview is
suitable. For simple features best covered as an item in a bullet-point list
of features containing a few words on each, use "Bullet point: <The few words>"
