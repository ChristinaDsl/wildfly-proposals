== Overview

This proposal is to add support for the External HTTP mechanism with Elytron. This mechanism will perform no verification,
but will authenticate a user based on credentials established externally. This will be used to accept a principal which
is passed by the `REMOTE_USER` attribute in the AJP protocol.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* New HTTP `ExternalAuthenticationMechanism`, `ExternalMechanismFactory`, and `WildFlyElytronHttpExternalProvider` classes
* Ability to pass `REMOTE_USER` attribute from undertow to Elytron (via elytron-web)

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

* Note: This RFE does not make changes to the mod_cluster subsystem but will update the documentation to describe how to use the External mechanism for authentication with the Elytron subsystem

== Test Plan

* Tests will be added to the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tree/master/testsuite/integration/web[wildfly/testsuite/integration/web testsuite] to test successful HTTP authentication with the External
mechanism
* Tests will be added to the https://github.com/wildfly-security/wildfly-elytron/tree/1.x/tests[wildfly-elytron testsuite] to test the new mechanism's functionality
* Tests will be added to the https://github.com/wildfly-security/elytron-web/tree/1.x/undertow/src/test[elytron-web/undertow testsuite] to test successful HTTP authentication with the External mechanism

== Community Documentation

* Documentation will be added to https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/_elytron/General_Elytron_Architecture.adoc#http-authentication[General Elytron Architecture]
to reference the new mechanism being added.
* Documentation will be added to https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/_high-availability/subsystem-support/mod_cluster_Subsystem.adoc[mod_cluster Subsystem] describing how to configure
Elytron to authenticate a `REMOTE_USER` via the External HTTP Mechanism

== Release Note Content
Users are now able to configure Elytron to use credentials established externally from the server to authenticate the
client with HTTP. This will allow users to propagate authentication from mod-cluster/ajp to WildFly.
