== Overview

When using a Git repository to manage your WildFly configuration file history, it is possible to use an Elytron
configuration file for authentication. However, it is currently only possible to specify credentials to authenticate
with HTTP, not SSH, even though Git supports SSH authentication. This proposal is to add support for SSH authentication
for Git persistence using an Elytron configuration file.

It will be possible for users to specify location, filename (identity) and passphrase to an existing SSH private key to
be used as credentials for SSH authentication.

It will also be possible for users to specify the keys to be used for authentication as KeyPairCredentials. This will mean
supporting specifying KeyPairCredentials in an Elytron configuration file as a credential or as a reference to an entry in
a CredentialStore. This will require modifying the `key-pair` credential to accept the OpenSSH
https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/PROTOCOL.key[private key] format. The user should then be able to
configure their WildFly standalone server to connect to a Git repo and authenticate with SSH to manage their configuration file history.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

==== JGit/SSHD
* It will be possible to connect to a remote git repo and authenticate using Elytron with SSH to manage the Git configuration
file history. This will be done using the Apache Mina SSHD session factory supported by JGit

==== Elytron Tool

The following commands will be added to the Elytron tool for offline CredentialStore manipulation:

* `--generate-key-pair` - this will generate a private and public key pair and store them in a credential store. Its argument
 will be the alias under which to store the credential. It will have the following options:
** `--algorithm` - mandatory, indicates the algorithm to be used to generate the keys: RSA, DSA, or ECDSA
** `--size` - the size of the key, only specified for RSA algorithm, by default is 2048 for RSA, 2048 for DSA and 256 for ECDSA
** `--passphrase` - an optional passphrase to be used to encode the key

* `--import-key-pair` - this will import a private key and store it in a credential stores. Its argument will be the alias
under which to store the credential. It will have the following options:
** `--private-key-string` - the private key to import as a String, mandatory if `--private-key-location` is
not defined
** `--private-key-location` - the path to and identity of the key (eg. ~/.ssh/id_rsa),  mandatory if `--private-key-string`
is not defined
** `--public-key-string` - the public key to import as a String, mandatory if `--public-key-location` is not defined and the
private key specified is not in OpenSSH format
** `--public-key-location` - the path to and identity of the key (eg. ~/.ssh/id_rsa),  mandatory if `--public-key-string`
is not defined and the private key specified is not in OpenSSH format
** `--passphrase` - an optional passphrase used to encode the private key

NOTE: The public key can be extracted from the encoded private key in OpenSSH format and a complete KeyPairCredential
can be created.

* `--export-key-pair-public-key` - this display the public key in itâ€™s OpenSSH encoded form. Its argument will be the alias
which the credential is stored under.

==== Elytron XML File

* It will be possible to specify SSH credentials to be used for authentication in the Elytron XML configuration file
** There will be the option to specify an `openssh-private-key` under the existing `key-pair` credential. This will parse
a private key encoded in OpenSSH format and generate the public and private keys in a KeyPairCredential.
** There will be the option to reference a KeyPairCredential stored in a CredentialStore
** It will be possible to specify the location and identity of a private key (eg. ~/.ssh/id_rsa) as a new `ssh-credential`
credential type. The user will also be able to specify the passphrase used to encode the key as a `clear-password`,
`masked-password`, or `credential-reference`.
** It will be possible to specify the location and filename of the known SSH hosts

NOTE: If no credentials are specified, authentication will be attempted with the default location `~/.ssh` and default
key identities: `id_rsa, id_dsa, id_ecdsa` and the known hosts files: `known_hosts`.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

==== JGit/SSHD

* Tests will be added to the WildFly-Core testsuite to test SSH authentication when connecting to a Git repository
** Tests will be added to test successful authentication when specifying the location, name, and passphrase to the file
containing a private key
** Tests will be added to test successful authentication using a KeyPairCredential with all supported formats
** Tests will be added to test unsuccessful authentication when no correct credentials are provided

==== Elytron Tool

* Tests will be added to the Elytron testsuite to test generating and importing a KeyPairCredential successfully into
 a CredentialStore with all supported algorithms

==== Elytron XML File
* Tests will be added to test parsing of a `key-pair` credential type in the OpenSSH format for all supported algorithms

== Community Documentation

* Documentation will be added to https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/_admin-guide/management-tasks/Configuration_file_git_history.adoc[Git Configuration File History]
under a new section SSH Authentication detailing how to configure SSH authentication with the different possible credential
configurations.
* Documentation will be added to https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/_elytron/Credential_Store.adoc[Credential Store]
to describe the new options to generate and import KeyPairCredentials
* Documentation will be added to https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/_client-guide/authentication-client.adoc[Authentication Client]
to describe the changes to the KeyPairCredential and the new option to specify a private keys location as a credential.

== Release Note Content

Currently, WildFly users can use a Git repository to manage their configuration file history of their standalone server.
While previously it was only possible to establish a connection with HTTP authentication, it is now possible to establish
a connection with SSH authentication using an Elytron configuration file to specify the credentials to be used.
