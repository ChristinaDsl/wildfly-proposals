== Overview

Currently, Elytron role mapping consist mostly of logical and basic add suffix/prefix RoleMappers, which makes it hard to map roles based on an actual map. This task is to introduce more ways of mapping roles, such as using a map or regex, without the customers needing to implement their own custom components.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Implement a Map backed RoleMapper for a -> b mapping. There should be options to keep/remove the original mapped role, and to keep/remove roles that weren't mapped. The map would map a role to one or more new roles.
* The format of role to be mapped is simple string, roles to which the role should be mapped are comma delimited in a string. In model this makes up a MAP of LIST, where the keys represent roles to be mapped and the representing values are LISTs of STRINGs, which represent the resulting roles.

<mappers>
...
	<mapped-role-mapper name="my-mapped-role-mapper" keep-mapped="true" keep-non-mapped="false" />
		<role-mapping from="roleToMap" to="mappedRole1,mappedRole2" />
		<role-mapping from="foo" to="joe,bar" />
	</mapped-role-mapper>
...
</mappers>

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Implement a regex based RoleMapper. This could make current prefix/suffix RoleMappers obsolete and create a single universal solution for easy role transformation. 
[source,xml]
----
<mappers>
...
	<regex-role-mapper name="my-regex-role-mapper" pattern=".*@(.*)" replacement="prefix$1suffix" />
...
</mappers>

----

* By combining this regex based mapper and mapped role mapper we could achieve similar functionality as mapped-regex-realm-mapper, but for roles.

== Test Plan

* Mapping functionality tests will be added to Elytron.
