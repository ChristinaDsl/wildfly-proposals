== Overview

`file-audit-endpoint` currently provides `synchronized` attribute, which allows to set whether should
be output stream flushed and file descriptor synced after writing every audit log message.
To have it enabled entail big performance drop, while have it disabled provides minimal data safety.
Should be possible to use compromise - as in legacy audit log, to flush stream only.

More fine-tuned settings will be possible if the two can be set separately - standalone
atttribute for stream flushing (`autoflush` for example) and for file descriptor syncing
(`synchronized` for example).

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* It should be possible to configure file descriptor syncing and output stream flushing independently.
* For backward compatibility, when new attribute(s) will not be used, current behavior needs to be preserved - attribute `synchronized` will set both options.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

Subsystem parsing and transformer tests will be added.
