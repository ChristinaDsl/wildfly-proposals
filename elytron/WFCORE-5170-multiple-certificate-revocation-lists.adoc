== Overview

Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) contain a list of certificates that have been revoked
by the issuing Certificate Authority before their expected expiration date, and therefore should no longer
be trusted. Elytron currently supports configuring one Certificate Revocation List.

However, if several Certificate Authorities are used, there is no way to configure several
CRL files. This task is to enable support for more than one Certificate Revocation List in Elytron.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Add a new attribute ``certificate-revocation-lists`` in the ``trust-manager`` resource in the Elytron subsystem:

** The ``trust-manager`` must be able to use the CRLs obtained from the distribution points referenced
in the certificates using the ``certificate-revocation-lists`` attribute as follows:

    /subsystem=elytron/trust-manager=myTrustManager:write-attribute(name=certificate-revocation-lists,value=[])

** Alternatively, the ``trust-manager`` must be able to configure CRLs using certificate revocation
list objects (which override the CRLs referenced in the distribution points). These objects have the
attributes ``path`` and ``relative-to`` which specify the path to the CRL and the
base path to the CRL respectively. These objects can be configured as follows:

    /subsystem=elytron/trust-manager=myTrustManager:write-attribute(name=certificate-revocation-lists, value=[{path=/path/to/CRL_FILE.crl.pem, relative-to=/SOME/DIRECTORY},
    {path=/path/to/CRL_FILE2.crl.pem, relative-to=/SOME/DIRECTORY}])

** The current client side schema to configure ``certificate-revocation-lists`` in ``wildfly-config.xml`` looks as follows:

    <ssl-context name="...">
        <trust-store key-store-name="..."/>
        <certificate-revocation-list path="/path/to/CRL.pem" maximum-cert-path="2"/>
    </ssl-context>

** The proposed client side schema should support the new attribute ``certificate-revocation-lists`` which
contains multiple ``certificate-revocation-list`` objects as follows:

    <ssl-context name="...">
        <trust-store key-store-name="..."/>
        <certificate-revocation-lists>
            <certificate-revocation-list path="/path/to/CRL.pem"/>
            <certificate-revocation-list path="/path/to/CRL2.pem" />
        </certificate-revocation-lists>
    </ssl-context>

NOTE: The ``certificate-revocation-list`` objects under the ``certificate-revocation-lists`` attribute
will not allow the configuration of a ``maximum-cert-path`` for each CRL, as this attribute has been
deprecated. Instead, it assumes this value has been configured
as an attribute for the trust manager.

* As the new ``certificate-revocation-lists`` attribute can pose more complexity in the CLI,
the existing attribute ``certificate-revocation-list`` should be kept. These attributes should be
mutually exclusive.

* For older schema versions, the ``certificate-revocation-lists`` attribute will be transformed
to ``certificate-revocation-list`` in the following two cases:

** When the ``certificate-revocation-lists`` attribute is holding a single CRL object,
it will be converted to ``certificate-revocation-list``.

** When the ``certificate-revocation-lists`` is empty it indicates the distribution points
should be used. It will then be converted to an empty ``certificate-revocation-list``.

== Test Plan

The following test scenarios will be added to the WildFly Elytron test suite:

* One way SSL tests where a client configures a single CRL under the certificate-revocation-lists
attribute. A server is configured to send a certificate which is present in the CRL
configured in the client. Communication is expected to fail.

* One way SSL tests where a client configures multiple CRLs under the certificate-revocation-lists
attribute. A server is configured to send a certificate which is present in one of the CRLs configured by the client.
Communication is expected to fail.

* One way SSL tests where a client configures multiple CRLs under the certificate-revocation-lists
attribute. A server is configured to send a certificate
*not* present in any of the CRLs configured by the client. Communication is expected to succeed.

* Two way SSL test where a server configures a list of CRLs containing a single CRL. The client configures no CRLs,
but it sends a certificate present in the CRL configured by the server. Communication is expected to fail.

* Two way SSL test where a server configures a list of CRLs containing a single CRL.
The client configures no CRLs, and it sends a certificate *not* present in the CRL
configured by the server. Communication is expected to succeed.

* Two way SSL test where a server configures a list of CRLs containing multiple
CRLs. The client configures no CRLs, but it sends a certificate present in one of the
CRLs configured by the server. Communication is expected to fail.

* Two way SSL test where a server configures a list of CRLs containing two CRLs.
The client configures no CRLs, and it sends a certificate *not* present in any of the CRLs
configured by the server. Communication is expected to succeed.

The following test scenarios will be added to the WildFly Core test suite:

* A test to ensure the management system adequately creates trust managers containing multiple
certificate revocation lists using the ``certificate-revocation-lists`` attribute. It would additionally verify
the trust manager can be reloaded successfully.

* A test to ensure the management system adequately creates a trust manager where the CRLs are
specified using the distribution points by specifying an empty ``certificate-revocation-lists`` attribute.

The following test scenarios will be added to the WildFly test suite:

* A web application secured using an Elytron ``server-ssl-context`` backed by a ``trust-manager`` configured with
multiple certificate revocation lists. The test would check certificate based
authentication succeeds when connecting to a server which sends a certificate not present in the certificate
revocation lists.
Additionally, they would check
certificate based authentication fails if the client provides a certificate present in any of the CRLs configured.


* Subsystem parsing to verify the parsing of older version of the model in addition to
testing the parsing of the current version including the new configuration options.

* Transformer tests to verify the ``certificate-revocation-lists`` attribute gets
converted into ``certificate-revocation-list`` when containing a single list or empty. Otherwise, the
attribute ``certificate-revocation-lists`` should be rejected.


== Community Documentation

* Documentation will be added to the "Using the Elytron Subsystem"
section in the WildFly documentation, specifically under https://docs.wildfly.org/20/WildFly_Elytron_Security.html#configure-ssltls[4.3.3. Configure certificate revocation in trust-manager].
The new documentation will specify that multiple certificate revocation lists are supported.

== Release Note Content

Elytron previously supported configuring one certificate revocation list. However, if
several Certificate Authorities were used, there was no
way to configure more than one certificate revocation file.
It is now possible to configure multiple certificate revocation lists in Elytron.
