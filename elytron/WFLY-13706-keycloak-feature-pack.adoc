== Overview

Support to secure deployments using OpenID Connect is presently provided by installing the Keycloak client adapters.

This is documented by the Keycloak project at https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#_jboss_adapter.

The general installation approach is to unzip the Keycloak adapters jar in the root of the WildFly installation, this installs
a number of modules and provides some CLI scripts to complete the configuration.  Next execute one of the CLI scripts to install
the Keycloak subsystem and activate the default mapping from the `undertow` subsystem to use a newly installed `http-authentication-factory`
which supports OpenID Connect.

The following gist approximately shows the changes made by completing the client adapter installation process:

To be discussed.

This feature is being developed across two different projects with engineers and quality engineers from
both the WildFly and Keycloak projects being involved, we need to agree the division across these four groups.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

A new Galleon feature pack will be added to the Keycloak project with the group and artifact IDs `org.keycloak:keycloak-adapter-galleon-pack`,
this new feature pack will contain a single layer `keycloak-client-oidc` - where this feature pack and layer are provisioned to a WildFly installation
the end result is expected to mostly match the results of manually installing the Keycloak adapter using the instructions linked previously.

Conceptually this includes the following steps:

 # Installing a set of modules under `modules/system/add-ons`
 # Registering the `org.keycloak.keycloak-adapter-subsystem` extension.
 # Adding an empty `urn:jboss:domain:keycloak:1.1` subsystem.
 # Adding the required resources to the `elytron` subsystem to result in an `http-authentication-factory` supporting OpenID Connect being available.
 # Adding an `application-security-domain` mapping to the `undertow` subsystem to map the default security domain to the new `http-authentication-factory`.

The scripts that would have been added via the manual installation steps are not added to the resulting installation as the configuration is already added.

The Keycloak release cadences differ from the WildFly release cadences, this means anyone using Galleon to keep their WildFly
installation up to date may receive updates to the core WildFly installation independently of the Keycloak feature pack.

Testing the interaction of versioning across the feature packs is going to be important, the installation of the Keycloak feature pack
should not prevent the server being updates once later versions become available, additionally the release of WildFly should not trigger the need for
an update to Keycloak.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

It is preferable for this new feature pack to just have dependencies on WildFly Core keeping it independent of WildFly, this needs to be
explored further but may not be possible.  Firstly the Keycloak adapter brings in modules with dependencies on artifacts only available from
the WildFly feature packs, secondly the feature pack will be required to add some configuration to the `undertow` subsystem so needs to depend
on a layer which adds Undertow.

This feature request is bringing the Keycloak client adapters to WildFly via a Galleon feature pack, beyond that no further
requirements are being considered, long term it is anticipated we will provide our own OpenID Connect support which will allow
the dependencies across the two projects to be reduced.  At the point we add our own OpenID Connect support we will also
consider the options to simplify the approach from an end users perspective.

=== Non-Requirements

This is exclusively adding support for the OpenID Connect client adapter support, alternatives such as SAML are out of scope.

Published artifacts will be available from online maven repositories only, no offline maven repository support will be provided.

The feature pack and resulting layer being provisioned are for securing web applications accessed directly via HTTP.
This feature request does not extend to securing management interfaces, Remoting invocations or EJB over HTTP invocations.

This feature pack will operate exclusively with Elytron based security, support for legacy security integration is outside the scope
of this enhancement.

The `keycloak-client-oidc` layer has built up numerous dependencies over it's evolution including projects such as PicketBox,
this enhancement is not reworking the Keycloak adapter integration to minimise these dependencies.

== Examples

This section contains examples of how the new feature pack will be installed using different approaches.

=== Provisioned using the Galleon CLI

A server installation can be provisioned using the Galleon CLI which would need to be downloaded and installed first.

Start the CLI:

----
java -jar galleon-cli-4.2.6.Final-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

First provision a WildFly server with the `web-server` later:

----
install wildfly:20.0#20.0.0.Final --layers=web-server --dir=/home/darranl/tmp/galleon/wildfly
----

Then install the Keycloak adapters:

----
install org.keycloak:keycloak-adapter-galleon-pack:12.0.0-SNAPSHOT --layers=keycloak-client-oidc --dir=/home/darranl/tmp/galleon/wildfly
----

=== Provisioned using org.jboss.galleon:galleon-maven-plugin.

The following is an example of using the `galleon-maven-plugin` to provision a server containing the Keycloak
adapter subsystem.

=== Provisioned using org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-jar-maven-plugin

There are two different approaches available to configure the `wildfly-jar-maven-plugin`, we can either define both feature packs within
the pom.xml or we can use a `provisioning.xml` descriptor to describe the desired server.

==== Inline Configuration

The following is an example defining the complete configuration within the pom.xml of the project.

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>wildfly-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${version.wildfly.jar.maven.plugin}</version>
    <configuration>
        <feature-packs>
            <feature-pack>
                <location>wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):current#21.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT</location>
                <inherit-configs>false</inherit-configs>
                <inherit-packages>false</inherit-packages>
            </feature-pack>
            <feature-pack>
                <groupId>org.keycloak</groupId>
                <artifactId>keycloak-adapter-galleon-pack</artifactId>
                <version>12.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
                <inherit-configs>false</inherit-configs>
                <inherit-packages>false</inherit-packages>
            </feature-pack>
        </feature-packs>
        <layers>
            <layer>web-server</layer>
            <layer>keycloak-client-oidc</layer>
        </layers>
        <context-root>simple-webapp</context-root>
        <cli-sessions>
            <cli-session>
                <script-files>
                    <script>configure-oidc.cli</script>
                </script-files>
            </cli-session>
        </cli-sessions>
    </configuration>
    ....
</plugin>
----

==== provisioning.xml Configuration

The server to be provisioned can also be defined within a `provisioning.xml` descriptor.

An example configuration adding the Keycloak client adapters to an installation can be seen here.

.provisioning.xml
[source,xml]
----
<installation xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:provisioning:3.0">
    <feature-pack location="wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):current#21.0.0.Beta1-SNAPSHOT">
        <default-configs inherit="false"/>
        <packages inherit="false">
            <exclude name="product.conf"/>
            <exclude name="docs.schema"/>
        </packages>
    </feature-pack>
    <feature-pack location="org.keycloak:keycloak-adapter-galleon-pack:12.0.0-SNAPSHOT">
        <default-configs inherit="false"/>
        <packages inherit="false"/>
    </feature-pack>
    <config model="standalone" name="standalone.xml">
        <layers>
            <include name="web-server"/>
            <include name="keycloak-client-oidc"/>
        </layers>
    </config>
    <options>
        <option name="optional-packages" value="passive+"/>
    </options>
</installation>
----

The `wildfly-jar-maven-plugin` can then be defined as:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>wildfly-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${version.wildfly.jar.maven.plugin}</version>
    <configuration>
        <root-url-path>simple-webapp</root-url-path>
        <provisioning-file>provisioning.xml</provisioning-file>
        <cli-sessions>
            <cli-session>
                <script-files>
                    <script>configure-oidc.cli</script>
                </script-files>
            </cli-session>
        </cli-sessions>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>package</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

NOTE: The use of a `provisioning.xml` descriptor is also usable with the other provisioning mechanisms, however
this enhancement is considering the feature pack added for Keycloak so will not repeat the `provisioning.xml`
example further.

== Implementation Plan

The new feature pack will hosted within the Keycloak project, no specific development is required within WildFly.
Releases of this feature pack will be subject to the Keycloak release cadences.

As described below the WildFly project will contain some community documentation but beyond that the WildFly project
will have no dependency back to the Keycloak project and feature pack.

== Test Plan

To be discussed.

The adapters already exist and are already in use today, this enhancement is not making changes so in depth testing of
the adapter is not required.

Generally testing is going to need to be focussed on the provisioning of the feature pack using the supported mechanism,
this is complicated by the code belonging in the KeyCloak repository whilst being exclusively for use against WildFly.


== Community Documentation

Community documentation will be added for WildFly users giving them information on how to provision this feature
pack, likely via the following three approaches:

 * Galleon command line.
 * Provisioned via plug-in - galleon-maven-plugin.
 * Provisioned for bootable jar - wildfly-jar-maven-plugin

The Keycloak adapter allows configuration to be provided either via the subsystem or via a descriptor contained
within the deployment, the community documentation will provide some minimal examples of using these.

Beyond this end users should refer to the Keycloak documentation for more detailed information.

=== Quickstarts

To be discussed.

The development of traditional quickstarts is difficult as to demonstrate this feature a working Keycloak installation
is also required.

Alternatively it may be beneficial to publish either blogs or even videos demonstrating the use of this feature in
different environments.

== Release Note Content

To be discussed.

Other than community documentation this will not actually be included in any WildFly release as it is a
feature pack to be installed on top of an existing release.  We may want to consider alternative publicity 
once this is usable.
