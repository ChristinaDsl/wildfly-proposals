== Overview

Currently, permission mappings and constant permission mappers in the Elytron subsystem configuration
can only reference individual permissions. This task is to introduce named permission sets and allow
these to be referenced from permission mappings and constant permission mappers. Referencing individual
permissions from permission mappings and constant permission mappers will still be allowed but will
deprecated to discourage further use.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* It should be possible to configure named permission sets in the Elytron subsystem configuration. Each permission
  set should contain zero or more permissions. It should be possible to reference permission sets from permission
  mappings and from constant permission mappers. As an example, the default configuration would be as shown below.
  Notice that the default permissions will be in a default permission set, "default-permissions", that is referenced by
  the "default-permission-mapper". For the provisioning tool, the default permission set will be the single place to add
  permissions as subsystems are being added and it will be the single place to remove permissions as subsystems are being
  removed. Without named permission sets, the provisioning tool would not know which permission mapping a subsystem
  permission should be added to or removed from. Note that the provisioning tool will only be touching the "default-permissions".
  It won't attempt to touch any user-specified permission sets.

        <permission class-name="org.wildfly.security.auth.permission.LoginPermission"/>
    </permission-set>
    <permission-set name="default-permissions">
        <permission class-name="org.wildfly.extension.batch.jberet.deployment.BatchPermission" module="org.wildfly.extension.batch.jberet" target-name="*"/>
        <permission class-name="org.wildfly.transaction.client.RemoteTransactionPermission" module="org.wildfly.transaction.client"/>
        <permission class-name="org.jboss.ejb.client.RemoteEJBPermission" module="org.jboss.ejb-client"/>
    </permission-set>
</permission-sets>
----

* A permission set should be a private capability.

* When transforming the model for legacy slaves, the permission sets should be in-lined, i.e., a permission set that's
  referenced from a permission mapping or from a constant permission mapper would just be replaced with the permissions
  that make up the permission set. For example, the "default-permissions" permission set referenced from the permission
  mappings in the above example would be transformed to:

[source,xml]
----
<permission class-name="org.wildfly.extension.batch.jberet.deployment.BatchPermission" module="org.wildfly.extension.batch.jberet" target-name="*"/>
<permission class-name="org.wildfly.transaction.client.RemoteTransactionPermission" module="org.wildfly.transaction.client"/>
<permission class-name="org.jboss.ejb.client.RemoteEJBPermission" module="org.jboss.ejb-client"/>
----

* Referencing individual permissions from permission mappings and constant permission mappers should still be allowed but
  should deprecated to discourage further use.

* Since we are not removing the permission element from permission mappings or constant permission mappers, there is no
  need to migrate XML configuration for prior versions to the new version.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

Subsystem parsing and transformer tests will be added.
