== Overview

Elytron provides support for `X509PeerCertificateChainEvidence`, i.e., evidence that is composed of a
verified X509 certificate chain. Currently, the principal that is associated with this type of evidence
is hard-coded to be the subject from the first certificate in the certificate chain, as an `X500Principal`.
This principal then gets mapped/rewritten using the configured principal decoders and principal transformers
to obtain the name that should be used when locating and loading the identity from the underlying identity store.

The https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt[X509 v3 Subject Alternative Name extension] provides the ability
to specify one or more alternative non-X500 names that can be used in addition to or instead of the
certificate's subject name. It should be possible to specify that one of these alternative names should be
used as the principal associated with `X509PeerCertificateChainEvidence`. This principal will then get
mapped/rewritten using the configured principal decoders and principal transformers to obtain the name that
should be used when locating and loading the identity from the underlying identity store.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* A new `org.wildfly.security.evidence-decoder` capability will be added.

* It should be possible to configure an `x509-subject-alt-name-evidence-decoder` in the `mappers` configuration
in the Elytron subsystem. This evidence decoder will be used to decode the principal that should be associated
with the given `X509PeerCertificateChainEvidence`. In particular, this new resource will have the following two
attributes:

** `alt-name-type` - The subject alternative name type to decode from the given `X509PeerCertificateChainEvidence` evidence.
This attribute is required. Must be one of the subject alternative name types that can be represented as a `String`:
*** `rfc822Name`
*** `dNSName`
*** `uniformResourceIdentifier`
*** `iPAddress`
*** `registeredID`
*** `directoryName`

** `segment` - The 0-based occurrence of the subject alternative name to map. This attribute is optional and only used
when there is more than one subject alternative name of the given `alt-name-type`. The default value is `0`.

For example, consider the following X509 v3 Subject Alternative Name extension from the first certificate in an
`X509PeerCertificateChainEvidence`:

[source,xml]
----
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:one.example.org, IP Address:127.0.0.1
----

To associate the evidence with the principal "one.example.org", the following `x509-subject-alt-name-evidence-decoder`
could be configured:

[source,xml]
----
<mappers>
...
    <x509-subject-alt-name-evidence-decoder name="dnsDecoder" alt-name-type="dNSName"/>
...
</mappers>
----

Next, consider following X509 v3 Subject Alternative Name extension from the first certificate in an `X509PeerCertificateChainEvidence`:

[source,xml]
----
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
    DNS:one.example.org, DNS:two.example.org, IP Address:127.0.0.1
----

To associate the evidence with the principal "two.example.org", the following `x509-subject-alt-name-evidence-decoder`
could be configured:

[source,xml]
----
<mappers>
...
    <x509-subject-alt-name-evidence-decoder name="dnsDecoder" alt-name-type="dNSName" segement="1"/>
...
</mappers>
----

* It should be possible to configure an `x500-subject-evidence-decoder` in the `mappers` configuration in the
Elytron subsystem. This evidence decoder will be used to decode the principal that should be associated with the given
`X509PeerCertificateChainEvidence`.This evidence decoder will extract the subject from the first certificate in the
certificate chain, as an `X500Principal`. Example configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<mappers>
...
    <x500-subject-evidence-decoder name="subjectDecoder"/>
...
</mappers>
----

* It should be possible to configure a `custom-evidence-decoder` in the `mappers` configuration in the Elytron
subsystem in order to make use of a custom `EvidenceDecoder` implementation. This will have the same attributes
as any other Elytron custom component.

* It should be possible to configure an `aggregate-evidence-decoder` in the `mappers` configuration in the Elytron subsystem.
This will consist of two or more `evidence-decoder` elements where each element will contain a reference to a configured
evidence decoder. Given evidence, these evidence decoders will be attempted in order until one returns a non-null principal
or until there are no more evidence decoders left to try.

Example configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<mappers>
...
    <x509-subject-alt-name-evidence-decoder name="emailDecoder" alt-name-type="rfc822Name"/>
    <x509-subject-alt-name-evidence-decoder name="dnsDecoder" alt-name-type="dNSName"/>
    <x500-subject-evidence-decoder name="subjectDecoder" />
    <aggregate-evidence-decoder name="aggregateDecoder">
        <evidence-decoder name="emailDecoder"/>
        <evidence-decoder name="subjectDecoder"/>
        <evidence-decoder name="dnsDecoder"/>
    </aggregate-evidence-decoder>
...
</mappers>
----

* It should be possible to configure an `evidence-decoder` for a `security-domain` in the Elytron subsystem. This optional
attribute will be a reference to an evidence decoder that has been configured in the `mappers` configuration in the
Elytron subsystem.

** If no `evidence-decoder` is specified for a `security-domain`, then the principal associated with the evidence will
just be the default principal for the evidence type, i.e., for `X509PeerCertificateChainEvidence`, this would continue to
default to the subject from the first certificate in the certificate chain, as an `X500Principal`.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

Elytron subsystem parsing and transformer tests will be added. Tests will be added to both the Elytron testsuite and the
Elytron subsystem tests to ensure that the correct principal is extracted from `X509PeerCertificateChainEvidence` based
on the configured evidence decoders.

== Community Documentation

Documentation on evidence decoders will be added to the "Elytron Subsystem" section in the WildFly documentation.
