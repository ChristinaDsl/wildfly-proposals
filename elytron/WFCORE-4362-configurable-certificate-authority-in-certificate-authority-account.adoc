== Overview

Currently, Let's Encrypt (https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory) is the only certificate authority
that can be used in a `certificate-authority-account` resource.
This issue aims to make it possible for the user to configure attribute `certificate-authority` for this resource.
Each certificate authority can be associated with a production url and a staging url, both of which have to be configurable.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

It must be possible to specify staging url and production url for the attribute `certificate-authority` in the `certificate-authority-account` resource.
This will be achieved by adding new resource `certificate-authority` to the elytron subsystem.

Eg. the configuration will look like the following:

```
/subsystem=elytron/certificate-authority=Buypass:add(url="https://api.buypass.com/acme/directory",staging-url="https://api.staging-example.com/acme/directory")
/subsystem=elytron/certificate-authority-account=exampleCertificateAuthorityAccount:add(certificate-authority=Buypass,alias=example,key-store=exampleKS)
```

== Implementation Plan

Currently, `certificate-authority-account` contains optional attribute `certificate-authority` of type STRING.
The default and only allowed value is "LetsEncrypt".
We should be able to specify staging URL and production URL without breaking backwards compatibility.

In the Elytron subsystem, LetsEncrypt is a value of CertificateAuthority enum. This enum contains name, url and staging url.
We can add new `certificate-authority` resource to the elytron
subsystem with non-optional attributes `name`, `url` and optional attribute `staging-url`.
This way, during the configuration of `certificate-authority-account`
it will be possible to reference any `certificate-authority` previously added by attribute `name`.


The default value for `certificate-authority` attribute in `certificate-authority-account` will continue to be "LetsEncrypt" with url "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory" and staging-url  "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory" (same as before).
If user does not specify `certificate-authority` or specify it to be "LetsEncrypt", these default URLs will be set internally (`certificate-authority` with name "LetsEncrypt" will not be added to avoid changes to configuration and to keep backwards compatibility).
If user tries to add `certificate-authority` resource with name "LetsEncrypt`, an exception will be thrown to avoid discrepancies.

Implementation will require removal of the enum CertificateAuthority and adding of new class CertificateAuthorityDefinition that extends SimpleResourceDefinition.
Since AcmeAccountService class (service responsible for a single AcmeAccount instance) uses CertificateAuthority enum,
it will be changed to use certificate authority class instead.

== Test Plan

Tests will be added to Wildfly Core testsuite under Elytron directory.
Tests will cover:

* operation `write-attribute` that will change certificate authority in `certificate-authority-account`
* adding of `certificate-authority` resource
* adding of `certificate-authority` resource with both `url` and `staging-url` not specified - will fail
* that operation will fail when trying to use `staging-url` when none specified
* that `certificate-authority-account` operation `create-account` won't fail when `staging-url` is specified and staging=true
* that exception will be thrown when adding `certificate-authority` with "LetsEncrypt" name

== Community Documentation

`certificate-authority` resource will be documented in the WildFly documentation under Using the Elytron subsystem.
There is already an example about how to Configure a Letâ€™s Encrypt account.
In this example, a note will be added that LetsEncrypt is the default and therefore can be omitted or be replaced with other certificate authority.
Example of adding `certificate-authority` resource and passing its name to `certificate-authority-account` will be showed along with the note.
