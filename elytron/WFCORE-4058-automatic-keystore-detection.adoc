== Overview

* If a user does not specify the type of a file based KeyStore can we auto detect the type?

* There is most likely a finite set of types we would want to automatically recognise, possibly we could inspect the
contents ourselves to detect different types - alternative attempt initialisation of different KeyStore objects until one succeeds. With the latter we would need to be careful one doesn't silently succeed when it should have failed.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Point of this change is to be able to load keystore without specifying its type.

== Implementation Plan

* Finite set of supported keystore types for automatic detection: JKS, JCEKS, PKCS12, BKS, BCFKS, UBER
* Some types are fairly easily recognizable, as they start with magic number: JKS (0xfeedfeed), JCEKS (0xcececece) - although if a keystore starts with such number it doesn't necessarily mean that it is that type
* Detect types of encrypted keystores? They may be a good candidate for try until success (let the provider do the decryption for us)

* The idea is to prioritize different techniques with a priority
** Magic number or different recognizeable pattern - check if the store contains one of known magic numbers - if yes, then try to load it and see if it is really that keystore
** Try remaining supported types in a specific order / don't try anything and fail - the order will be determined using file extension

* Recognizable patterns:

** JKS
*** Starts with magic number 0xfeedfeed
*** Version number - 0x00000002 or 0x00000001

** JCEKS
*** Starts with magic number 0xcececece
*** Version number - 0x00000002 or 0x00000001

** BKS
*** Starts with version number 0x00000002 - older version (BKS-v1) has version number 0x00000001
*** Salt length - looking at the BC provider source I found out its 20, hopefully it't the only case - 0x00000014
*** Salt - 20 bytes
*** Iteration count - int with value 1024 - 2047 - 0x00000400 - 0x000007ff - top 21 bits are 0
**** 32 bytes until now
*** First entry type - byte of value 0-5 - first different pattern from UBER


** BCFKS
*** ASN.1 encoding - starts with SEQUENCE - tag 0x30

** PKCS12
*** ASN.1 encoding - starts with SEQUENCE - tag 0x30

** UBER
*** Starts with version number 0x00000001 or 0x00000000
*** Salt length - looking at the BC provider source I found out its 20, hopefully it't the only case - 0x00000014
*** Salt - 20 bytes
*** Iteration count - int with value 1024 - 2047 - 0x00000400 - 0x000007ff - top 21 bits are 0
**** 32 bytes until now (same as BKS)
*** encrypted data

== Test Plan

* TBD based on final implementation

== Community Documentation
////
Generally a feature should have documentation as part of the PR to wildfly master, or as a follow up PR if the feature is in wildfly-core. In some cases though the documentation belongs more in a component, or does not need any documentation. Indicate which of these will happen.
