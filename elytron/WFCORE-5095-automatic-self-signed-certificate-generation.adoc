== Overview

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-1576[WFCORE-1576] added the ability to lazily generate a
self-signed certificate on first use for a specified host name when using legacy security. This RFE is
to provide similar functionality when Elytron is in use. Like with legacy security, it will be important
to log a warning message so the user knows that a self-signed certificate is being used and to indicate
that this self-signed certificate should never be used in a production environment.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* When configuring a `key-manager` in the Elytron subsystem, it should be possible to specify
a `generate-self-signed-certificate-host` attribute. When this attribute is specified,
the key manager will lazily generate a self-signed certificate on first use (i.e., when
an HTTPS client connects to the server) if the key store associated with the key manager does
not yet exist. The value of the `generate-self-signed-certificate-host` attribute will be used
as the Common Name value when generating the self-signed certificate.
** When the `generate-self-signed-certificate-host` attribute has been specified for a `key-manager`
and the file that backs the corresponding `key-store` does not exist, a warning message will be logged
in the server.log file that indicates that a self-signed certificate will be generated on first use.
** Once generated, a warning message will be logged in the server.log file that indicates that a
self-signed certificate has been generated and that the self-signed certificate should only be used
for testing purposes and that it should never be used in a production environment. The message
will also provide the SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints of the generated public key.
** Once generated, the self-signed certificate will be persisted to the file that backs the key store.
(By persisting the self-signed certificate to the key store, this means that a user will only need
to compare the fingerprint to the one from the server.log file once and accept the certificate once.
If we don't persist the self-signed certificate to the key store and just generate a new one each time,
a user would need to compare the fingerprint to the one from the server.log file multiple times
and may become prone to simply accepting the server's certificate without proper inspection.)

* The default Elytron subsystem configuration should include one-way SSL configuration that specifies
a `key-manager` with the `generate-self-signed-certificate-host` attribute set to "localhost" as shown
below.

[source,xml]
----
<tls>
    <key-stores>
        <key-store name="applicationKS">
            <credential-reference clear-text="password"/>
            <implementation type="PKCS12"/>
            <file path="application.keystore" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir"/>
        </key-store>
    </key-stores>
    <key-managers>
        <key-manager name="applicationKM" key-store="applicationKS" generate-self-signed-certificate-host="localhost">
            <credential-reference clear-text="password"/>
        </key-manager>
    </key-managers>
    <server-ssl-contexts>
        <server-ssl-context name="applicationSSC" key-manager="applicationKM"/>
    </server-ssl-contexts>
</tls>
----

* It should be possible for a user to easily make use of the above `server-ssl-context` from the
default Elytron subsystem configuration by updating the `https-listener` configuration in the Undertow
subsystem configuration as follows:

[source,bash]
----
batch
/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=https:undefine-attribute(name=security-realm)
/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=https:write-attribute(name=ssl-context,value=applicationSSC)
run-batch
reload
----

* It should be possible for a user to easily disable the self-signed certificate generation by
removing the `generate-self-signed-certificate-host` attribute from the `key-manager` configuration.
To make use of HTTPS, the user would then need to add a signed certificate to the `key-store` (e.g.,
this could be done by obtaining a signed certificate from any certificate authority that
implements the ACME protocol using WildFly CLI commands) and the user would need to re-initialize
the `key-manager`.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

* The ability to automatically generate a signed certificate is out of the scope of this RFE but
would be good to investigate further after this task. WildFly already provides the ability
to easily obtain signed certificates from any certificate authority that implements the ACME
protocol.

== Test Plan

Elytron subsystem parsing and transformer tests will be added.

Tests will be added to the WildFly testsuite to verify that a self-signed certificate is
automatically generated on first use when Undertow is configured to make use of an
`https-listener` that references an `ssl-context` with a `key-manager` that specifies
the `generate-self-signed-certificate-host` attribute. Tests will also be added to verify
that the `generate-self-signed-certificate-host` attribute can be disabled properly.

== Community Documentation

Documentation on the new default TLS configuration and how to make use of the
`applicationSSC` `server-ssl-context` will be added to the "Default Application Authentication
Configuration" section in the Elytron documentation. Documentation on the
`generate-self-signed-certificate-host` attribute will also be added in this section along with
information on how to disable the self-signed certificate generation. A warning will also be added
in this section to note that the generated self-signed certificate is only intended for testing
purposes and that it should never be used in a production environment.

== Release Note Content

WildFly now provides the ability to lazily generate a self-signed certificate on first use
when using Elytron. This self-signed certificate should only be used for testing purposes.
It should never be used in a production environment.
