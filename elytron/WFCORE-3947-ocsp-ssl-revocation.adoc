=== Hard Requirements

* New class X509RevocationTrustManager
* Configurable certificate revocation using OCSP. This will be implemented using PKIXRevocationChecker.
* Configuration will be done using Builder class and will include:
** Current configuration in X509CRLExtendedTrustManager
** OCSP Responder URI for overriding default, where the default is retrieved from AIA extension (RFC5280) or from `ocsp.responderURL` security property
** Default revocation mechanism (OCSP/CRL) in a form of prefer-crls (by default OCSP if preferred)
** Fallback behaviour - cases for unavailable CRL / OCSP responder services
** Checking of leaf certificates only
* Deprecating X509CRLExtendedTrustManager, both mechanisms will share one class for fallback purposes and easier configuration

Current subsystem CRL configuration:

```xml
<trust-manager name="trust-with-ocsp-crl" algorithm="PKIX" key-store="ElytronCaTruststore">
    <certificate-revocation-list path="crl.pem" maximum-cert-path="2"/>
</trust-manager>
```

Proposed subsystem configuration:

```xml
<trust-manager name="trust-with-ocsp-crl" algorithm="PKIX" key-store="ElytronCaTruststore" soft-fail="true" only-leaf-cert="true" maximum-cert-path="2">
    <certificate-revocation-list path="crl.pem"/>
    <ocsp responder="responderUri" prefer-crls="true" responder-certificate="certalias" responder-keystore="responder-store"/>
</trust-manager>
```


New subsystem configuration elements:

 * `trust-manager` elements:
 ** `soft-fail` can pass certificates, where revocation status could not be obtained due to network or internal responder error. This is optional false by default.
 ** `only-leaf-cert` will check revocation status of only the leaf certificate. This is optional and false by default.
 ** `maximum-cert-path` moved from `certificate-revocation-list` to `trust-manager`, as this can be used by OCSP without CRL configured.
 * `ocsp` element:
 ** `responder` this overrides OCSP Responder URI resolved from certificate.
 ** `prefer-crls` when both OCSP and CRL is configured, OCSP will be executed first by default. When `prefer-crls` is true, CRL will be checked first instead.
 ** `responder-keystore` alternative keystore for responder certificate. `responder-certificate` must be defined.
 ** `responder-certificate` alias for responder certificate located int `responder-keystore` or `trust-manager` keystore if responder-keystore is not defined
Order of revocation mechanisms (if both are defined) will be based on attribute of `ocsp` - `prefer-crls`, defaults to false (OCSP prioritized by default).

Other configuration is done using security properties of elytron subsystem, see: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/certpath/CertPathProgGuide.html#AppC


==== Elytron client configuration

Current elytron-client configuration:

```xml
<ssl-context name="ssl-crl-context">
    <trust-store key-store-name="ca"/>
    <certificate-revocation-list path="crl.pem" maximum-cert-path=4/>
</ssl-context>
```


Proposed elytron-client configuration:

```xml
<ssl-context name="ssl-crl-context">
    <trust-store key-store-name="ca"/>
    <trust-manager algorithm="PKIX" maximum-cert-path=4 soft-fail="true" only-leaf-cert="true"/>
    <certificate-revocation-list path="crl.pem"/>
    <ocsp responder="responderUri" prefer-crls="true" responder-certificate="certalias" responder-keystore="responder-store"/>
</ssl-context>
```



Note: This RFE does not officially support OCSP stamping, but as the stamping support released with JDK9 http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/249[JEP249] is configured using Security and System properties, it will
be possible to configure and use it. Issues related to OCSP stamping will likely have another RFE with tests and more documentation.


=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

* OCSP tests in Elytron using mock OCSP Responder

== Community Documentation
////
Generally a feature should have documentation as part of the PR to wildfly master, or as a follow up PR if the feature is in wildfly-core. In some cases though the documentation belongs more in a component, or does not need any documentation. Indicate which of these will happen.
