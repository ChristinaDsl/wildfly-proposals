== Overview

Many subsystems currently support a ```credential-reference``` which is used to specify either a reference to
a credential that is stored in an Elytron credential store under a given alias or a clear text password. In
particular, a ```credential-reference``` supports specifying either of the following two mutually exclusive
things:

1. ```store``` and ```alias``` attributes which specify the Elytron credential store and the alias within the
store that hold a credential
2. ```clear-text``` attribute which specifies a clear text password

For the first case, a user needs to first create a credential store and add a credential to it before being able
to reference it from a ```credential-reference```.

This enhancement looks at relaxing the mutual exclusivity requirement to automate the process of adding or
updating a credential in an existing credential store to simplify the number of steps that a user needs to
perform.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

It should be possible for a `credential-reference` to support both a credential store (i.e., the `store`
attribute) and a clear text password (i.e., the `clear-text` attribute) to be specified at the same time.

When adding a new `credential-reference` with both the `store` and `clear-text` attributes specified:

* If the `alias` attribute is also specified, one of the following will then occur:

** If the credential store does not contain an entry for the given alias, a new entry will be added to the credential
store to hold the clear text password that was specified. The `clear-text` attribute will then be removed from the
management model.

** If the credential store does contain an entry for the given alias, the existing credential will be replaced with
the clear text password that was specified. The ```clear-text``` attribute will then be removed from the management
model.

* If the `alias` attribute is not specified, an alias will be generated and a new entry will be added to the
credential store to hold the clear text password that was specified. The `clear-text` attribute will then be
removed from the management model.

Note that if only the `clear-text` attribute is specified or if only the `store` and `alias` attributes
are specified when adding a new `credential-reference`, there will be no changes in behaviour.

When updating an existing `credential-reference` that contains both the `alias` and `store` attributes to
also specify the `clear-text` attribute:

* The existing credential will be replaced with the clear text password that was specified. The `clear-text`
attribute will then be removed from the management model.

In each of the above cases where adding or updating a `credential-reference` results in a new entry being added
to the credential store or an existing entry being updated in the credential store, the output of the management
operation will indicate this.

==== Rollback upon operation failure

If an operation that includes a `credential-reference` parameter fails for any reason, no automatic
credential store update will take place, i.e., any credential store that was specified via the
`credential-reference` attribute will contain the same contents as it did before the operation was
executed. The output of the management operation will indicate this.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

This enhancement will not add support for automatically creating credential stores. These will still need to be created
in advance by the user.

This enhancement will not add support for automatically adding and updating credentials in a credential store when
referencing credentials using the Elytron authentication client.

== Test Plan

Testing of this enhancement will happen within the WildFly Core testsuite. Tests will be added for the different
scenarios to make sure credentials can be automatically added and updated in credential stores appropriately.

== Community Documentation

Community documentation on credential stores is currently being added in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-11101[WFLY-11101].

This new documentation will be updated to include details on this new enhancement. The documentation will cover the
different scenarios related to automatically adding and updating credentials in credential stores.

== Release Notes

Instead of needing to first add a credential to a credential store in order to reference it from a `credential-reference`, WildFly 19 adds the ability to automatically add a credential to a previously defined credential store.
