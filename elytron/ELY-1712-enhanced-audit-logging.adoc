== Overview

Currently, Audit Logging in Elytron does not have the same capabilities as Legacy Security. This task is to enhance Elytron Audit Logging to have support for RFC5424/RFC3164 and add the additional ability to configure reconnect attempts.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Support for https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424[RFC 5424] should be enhanced, according to the following parameter,
which should be added to ```syslog-audit-log``` in the Elytron subsystem
** An optional ```syslog-format``` attribute should be added which supports a value of ```RFC5424```
** This attribute will also have ```RFC5424``` as the default value
** A Rfc5424SyslogEvent should be added as an audit event, which will have the ```RFC5424``` format as a property

* Support for https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164[RFC 3164] should be added to ```syslog-audit-log``` in the Elytron
subsystem
** The ```syslog-format``` attribute described in the RFC 5424 section above should also support a value of
 ```RFC3164```
** A Rfc3164SyslogEvent should be added as an audit event, which will have the ```RFC3164``` format as a property

* An initial message should be sent to the syslog server when the Elytron Subsystem syslog endpoint is created
** This message will indicate that Elytron audit logging is enabled and the format it is enabled with

* The ability to configure the amount of reconnect attempts should be added
** This should be done by configuring the number of reconnect attempts to a syslog-server
** This should be available as an attribute ```reconnect-attempts``` under ```syslog-audit-log``` in the Elytron
subsystem
** The possible values for this parameter would be: -1 - signifying indefinite attempts,
0 - signifying no attempts, and any positive integer - signifying that nunmber of attempts
** This would be an optional parameter and have a default value of 0
** This parameter will only apply for logging to a syslog server with UDP, since TCP already has reconnections
configured in the jboss-logmanager project
** This parameter will only apply if an IOException, such as the destination being unreachable, occurs while sending.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

Subsystem parsing and transformer tests will be added

== Community Documentation

These new Audit Logging capabilities will be documented in the WildFly documentation under Audit.
