== Overview
Elytron currently has an aggregate security realm which is a combination of two or more realms: an authentication realm
and one or more authorization realms. Currently, the principal undergoes transformations before being used to load the
aggregate identity, but there is no way to transform the principal in between loading the authentication identity and
loading the authorization identity. This would be needed in the case where the principal stored in the authentication realm
is different than the principal stored in the authorization realm(s).

This enhancement would allow transformations to be applied to the principal after loading the authentication identity
and before loading the authorization identity. The principal-transformer attribute will be added to aggregate-realm and
would be a reference to a transformer defined in the mappers configuration. It will be an optional attribute.

** Example configuration:

```
   /subsystem=elytron/aggregate-realm=AggregateRealm:add(authentication-realm=KeyStoreRealm,authorization-realm=ApplicationRealm,principal-transformer=myCustomTransformer)
```

== Requirements 

=== Hard Requirements

* It should be possible to configure an ```aggregate-realm``` with the optional attribute ```principal-transformer``` which
will define transformations to the principal after the authentication identity is obtained but before the authorization
identity is obtained. This principal transformer will be a reference to a ```principal-transformer``` that has been defined
in the ```mappers``` configuration in the Elytron subsystem.


=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan
Subsystem parsing and transformer tests will be added. Tests will also be added to the Elytron testsuite and the Elytron
subsystem tests to ensure that the principal is correctly transformed after authentication and before authorization.

== Community Documentation
Documentation will be added in the "Aggregate Security Realm" section under elytron/components in the WildFly documentation to indicate that a
principal transformer can be used between authentication and authorization for ```aggregate-realm```
