== Overview

It is not currently possible to reload Elytron's trust-manager dynamically, requiring WildFly to be restarted to see changes to any keystore take effect. This feature is currently available for key-manager with the init operation. This task is to add a similar operation to trust-manager.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* When changes are made to key stores used in the trust-manager, it should be possible to reload these key stores in the trust-manager without having to restart the server. This should be done by adding a init operation to the Elytron subsystem's trust-manager resource. This new management operation will not take any parameters and will be a runtime only operation akin to the key-manager init operation.

[source,bash]
/subsystem=elytron/trust-manager=TRUST_MANAGER_NAME:init()

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

Tests to run the new CLI operation will be added.

== Community Documentation

This new management operation will be documented in the WildFly documentation under Using the Elytron subsystem.
