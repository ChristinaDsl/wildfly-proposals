== Overview

Elytron currently supports 6 SSL/TLS protocols. Namely, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, and
TLSv1.3. However, older JDK versions use ``SSLv2Hello`` during the initial
SSL handshake message where the SSL version that will be used for the rest of the handshake is negotiated.
Newer JDK versions disable this protocol by default, but do provide the ability to
re-enable it if needed. This task is to ensure Elytron can make use of the ``SSLv2Hello`` protocol to ensure feature parity with legacy security.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* It should be possible to configure a ``server-ssl-context`` and ``client-ssl-context`` in the Elytron
subsystem using the ``SSLv2Hello`` protocol as follows:

** ``server-ssl-context``:
[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/server-ssl-context=mySslContext:add(key-manager=myKeyManager,protocols=[SSLv2Hello,TLSv1])
----

** ``client-ssl-context``:
[source]
----
/subsystem=elytron/client-ssl-context=myClientSslContext:add(key-manager=myClientKeyManager,protocols=[SSLv2Hello,TLSv1])
----

* If the user is using a JDK version where ``SSLv2Hello`` is disabled by default, but they attempt to configure an  ``ssl-context`` with the
``SSLv2Hello`` protocol, the protocol should be enabled without further user intervention.

== Test Plan

* WildFly Elytron Test Suite: one-way and two-way SSL tests will be added that make use of the ``SSLv2Hello`` protocol.
* WildFly Core Test Suite: one-way and two-way SSL tests with the ``SSLv2Hello`` protocol when it is
 configured in the Elytron subsystem, subsystem parsing tests, transformer tests and
 a test added to the WildFly Core test suite to check usage of ``SSLv2Hello`` provided by OpenSSL provider.
* WildFly Test Suite: one-way and two-way SSL tests with the ``SSLv2Hello`` protocol.

== Community Documentation

* Documentation will be added in the "Using the Elytron Subsystem" section in the WildFly documentation,
specifically in under https://docs.wildfly.org/13/WildFly_Elytron_Security.html#configure-ssltls[4.3 Configure SSL/TLS]
to specify that ``SSLv2Hello`` is supported. A warning should also be added to indicate
that the use of this protocol is discouraged.

* Documentation will also be added under "Enable Two-way SSL/TLS in WildFly for Applications" to specify that ``SSLv2Hello``
is also supported for the client ssl context.

== Release Note Content

Older JDK versions use the protocol ``SSLv2Hello`` in the initial handshake message where the SSL version
that will be used for the rest of the handshake is negotiated. Although the usage of this protocol is discouraged,
and disabled by default in newer JDK versions, it is now possible to configure a client or server SSL context using the
``SSLv2Hello`` protocol in the Elytron subsystem
to ensure feature parity with legacy security configurations.
