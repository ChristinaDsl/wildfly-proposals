== Overview

This is a relatively simple enhancement to ensure that as the server is started a JVM wide default SSLContext is registered for the use of any libraries within the application server that support the use of the default context.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

At the root of the WildFly Elytron subsystem a new attribute `default-ssl-context` will be registered.  This will be a reference to resources providing the `org.wildfly.security.ssl-context` capability.

As the services for the subsystem start a reference to the `SSLContext` instance will be obtained and will be set globally using the API https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk11/docs/api/java.base/javax/net/ssl/SSLContext.html#setDefault(javax.net.ssl.SSLContext)[SSLContext.setDefault(SSLContext)].

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

None

=== Non-Requirements

Handling of the registration of a default SSLContext in stand alone clients will not be covered by this RFE.

This RFE is concerned with the registration of a single SSLContext, this RFE will not cover selecting alternative configurations based on the peer being accessed.

It will not be possible to cache a current default `SSLContext` as this would lead to redundant initialisation that could fail, additionally it is not possible to set the default to `null` to trigger initialisation on next access so the `SSLContext` will not be cleared if the subsystem is shut down.  Unsetting the `default-ssl-context` attribute would put the process in a `restart-required` state instead of `reload-required`.

== Test Plan

== Community Documentation

A small amount of documentation will be required describing the new attribute in the WildFly Elytron subsystem.
