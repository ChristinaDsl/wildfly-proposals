== Overview

Today the ability to integrate custom Galleon feature-packs and layers during s2i build phase is limited and not flexible. We are here proposing
to evolve it with new configuration points and behavior.

* [ ] Managed domain

* [x] OpenShift s2i

* [ ] Bootable jar

== Requirements

* Ability to configure the location of the custom Galleon content a user is providing.

* Ability to provide a settings.xml file used during galleon provisioning of the server.

* Ability to locate un-released custom Galleon feature-packs in the application project. Custom galleon feature-packs are then copied to local maven cache 
to be used during provisioning.

* Ability to provide a list of custom Galleon feature-packs without requiring a provisioning.xml file. 

=== Hard Requirements

* Define new env variable: `GALLEON_DIR=<path relative to app root dir that contains Galleon content>`. Default being `galleon`. If the referenced directory doesn't
exist, the build phase aborts.

 * A settings.xml file can be located in the `${GALLEON_DIR: galleon}` dir and used during provisioning. Any local repository configured in such settings are ignored. 
If no settings.xml is found, a default settings.xml is used.

* Define a new env variable: `GALLEON_CUSTOM_FEATURE_PACKS_MAVEN_REPO=<absolute path to a maven repo dir containing custom galleon feature-packs>`
By default we are looking into the `<src root dir>/${GALLEON_DIR:galleon}/repository`. Any path can be set for `GALLEON_CUSTOM_FEATURE_PACKS_MAVEN_REPO`, this allows to mount a volume containing the maven repo.
During s2i build, the content of the maven repository is copied to the local maven repository present in the image used to provision a server.
If the referenced directory doesn't exist, the build phase aborts.

* Define a new env variable: `GALLEON_PROVISION_FEATURE_PACKS=<comma separated list of custom galleon feature-packs GAV>`. The order is important, the feature-packs
are added to the provisioning context in the order of the list. If the one of the GAV is missing G, A or V, the build phase aborts.
This env variable can only be used in conjunction with the existing `GALLEON_PROVISION_LAYERS` that can now contain both WildFly s2i layers and custom layers.
 The feature-packs in the list can be retrieved from:
 ** Configured repos in the default settings.xml (the default)
 ** Repos configured in provided galleon/settings.xml
 ** Local to the application project (@see `GALLEON_CUSTOM_FEATURE_PACKS_MAVEN_REPO` usage).

Example: GALLEON_PROVISION_FEATURE_PACKS=com.foo.bar:foo:1.0 GALLEON_PROVISION_LAYERS=cloud-server,foo

* NB: If a layer in`GALLEON_PROVISION_LAYERS`doesn't exist, the build phase aborts. This is already the case.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* NONE

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

* New behave tests added to wildfly-s2i

* New functional tests should be added to QE testsuite.

== Community Documentation

The WildFly s2i doc will cover the new env variables.

== Release Note Content

Not candidate for release notes.
