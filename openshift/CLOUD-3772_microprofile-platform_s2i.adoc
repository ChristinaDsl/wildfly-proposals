== Requirements

=== Use 'microprofile-platform' Galleon layer decorator during S2I

During S2I build operated from an XP 2.0 builder image, a user can reference the layer 'microprofile-platform' in GALLEON_PROVISION_LAYERS environment variable. It is usable with
any base Galleon layer: 'datasources-web-server', 'jaxrs-server' and 'cloud server'

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* NONE

=== Non-Requirements

* NONE

== Implementation Plan

* No implementation required. We need to document and test this Galleon layer in the XP 2.0 S2I context.

== Test Plan

* Behave test added to repository https://github.com/jboss-container-images/jboss-eap-7-openshift-image. Test that we can provision all base layers with 
'microprofile-platform'.

* XP 2.0 Quickstarts to be tested on openshift with the combination: 'jaxrs-server' + 'microprofile-platform'

== Community Documentation

* The WildFly s2i https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i[documentation] will mention this Galleon layer.

== Release Note Content

* 'microprofile-platform' is a new Galleon decorator layer to provision Eclipse Microprofile subsystems that you 
can use during S2I build using the GALLEON_PROVISON_LAYERS environment variable.
