# Analysis Documents for WildFly

[.lead]
This repository is a central location for analysis and design documents of new features and capabilities in the https://wildfly.org[WildFly] project universe

A WildFly Analysis Document (or "proposal") is a way to
propose, communicate and coordinate on new efforts for the  project.

This process is evolving, but is mandatory for all new features and requirements for WildFly.

## Get Started

1. Socialize an idea with others.  Make sure others think the work is worth doing, and are willing to review design and code changes required.
2. Create a Pull Request with your new analysis document based on the link:./design-doc-template.adoc[template].

## FAQs

### Do I have to use the process?

Short story --  yes.

Long story -- if your work introduces new user-controllable behavior to WildFly, yes. Requirements not involving user-controllable behavior that are of sufficient complexity should also use the process.

### Why would I want to use the process?

It provides a mechanism to communicate features and requirements across the WildFly community. It also helps coordinate and collaborate on related requirements.

### Do I put my analysis document in a particular directory?

If it fits in an existing directory, put it there.
Otherwise, you can create a new appropriate subdirectory.

### My FAQ isn't answered here

Please open an issue and ask or even better open a PR with a question and proposed answer.
