== Overview

As a developer, I can use a quickstart to showcase WildFly connecting to a DB on OpenShift.

This quickstart focused on cloud deployment and will use the bootable jar to provide the application.
The Web frontend will be an external application based on https://todobackend.com. The quickstart will provide the REST API expected by this application and will store the TODO items in a PostgreSQL DB hosted on OpenShift.

This quickstart will focus on OpenShift deployment and will provide developer insights for:

 * Developing a Java backend that exposes a HTTP API with JAX-RS and provides a JPA Model backed by a DB
 * Deploying this backed on OpenShift (both with EAP S2I and Bootable Jar)
 * Leverage Bootable Jar for local development (without cloud deployment)
 * Binding an EAP application to a DB on OpenShift
 * Expose an EAP application outside the OpenShift cluster
 * Support CORS filtering (so that a Web Frontend can access the HTTP API)

== Requirements

* Provides a new quickstart that showcases a typical use of WildFly: a backend that exposes a Web API (using JAX-RS) and connects to a DB (using JPA).
* The quickstart requires an external PostgreSQL database.
  * For local deployment, a PostgreSQL DB running in Docker will be used
  * For Cloud deployment, a PostgreSQL DB running in OpenShift will be used
* This quickstart will use a Helm Charts to be built and deployed on OpenShift. The configuration for the Helm Chart will be provided inside the quickstart directory.
* PostgreSQL drivers and datasources will be explicitly provided by the https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack[WildFly Feature Pack for DataSources].
* This quickstart will require CORS support:
  * A CLI script is provided to add CORS filters to Undertow when Bootable Jar is used
  * Environment variables that add CORS filters will be added to the Helm Chart when S2I is used to build and deploy the backend on OpenShift.

=== Hard Requirements

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

* This quickstart will *not* provide documentation to be deployed on a local WildFly Server with standalone configuration modification (the focus is local deployment and cloud deployment with Bootable Jar).

== Implementation Plan

Initial code will be contributed from https://github.com/jmesnil/quickstart/tree/todo-backend/todo-backend.
This `todo-backend` will be contributed to https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.

== Test Plan

== Community Documentation

Community documentation will be provided by the README in the quickstart directory (https://github.com/jmesnil/quickstart/blob/todo-backend/todo-backend/README.adoc[README's initial contribution]).

== Release Note Content

A new quickstart `todo-backend` showcases how WildFly can be deployed on OpenShift to provide a backend that exposes an HTTP API (using `JAX-RS`) and store data to a DB (using `JPA`).
