== Overview

Currently resource-adapter validation logs are not created because report-directory property that IronJacamar uses is always null. The goal of this RFE is to implement config of validator log directory so that customers can see result of the validation.

== Configuration

'report-directory' tag will be added to 'resource-adapters' subystem. The tag will contain a 'path' element which configures the location of a validation log.

{code}
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:resource-adapters:6.1">
  <resource-adapters>
  (...)
  </resource-adapters>
  <report-directory path="/foo/baz"/>
</subsystem>
{code}
