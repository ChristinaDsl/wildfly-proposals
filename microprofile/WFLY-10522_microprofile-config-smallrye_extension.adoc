== Overview

Support Eclipse MicroProfile Config for applications deployed in WildFly.
The integration uses the smallrye-config component to provide the MicroProfile Config implementation.

The code in smallrye-config and in the proposed WildFly extension has already been developed in the
https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-microprofile-config[wildfly-microprofile-config] and
was used in http://wildfly-swarm.io[WildFly Swarm].

This RFE moves the extension code to WildFly so that applications deployed on WildFly can also
benefit from the MicroProfile Config API.

=== Affected Projects or Components

The implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile Config is provided by https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config[smallrye-config].

=== Other Interested Projects

== Requirements

* Support Eclipse MicroProfile Config for any applications deployed in WildFly.
* The extension is added to *all* configuration provided by WildFly (standalone and domain mode).

== Implementation Plan

* Add dependencies to `smallrye-config` and `microprofile-config-api` artifacts
* Add a new `microprofile-config-smallrye` extension to provide Config support for deployments.
* Add subsystem resources to enhance MicroProfile Config (e.g to support OpenShift ConfigMaps,
  store properties in WildFly configuration XML files, etc.)

== Test Plan

* smallrye-config component is passing the MicroProfile Config TCK during its release process.
* WildFly integration test suite will be enhanced with tests that deploys Java archives which
uses the MicroProfile Config API.

== Community Documentation

The feature will be documented in WildFly Admin Guide (in a new MicroProfile Config section).
