== Overview

This RFE provides a new quickstart and guide for MicroProfile Metrics 2.3 use in WildFly /
JBoss EAP. The example will cover all basic functionalities of MicroProfile Metrics 2.3,
namely: usage of individual application metrics (annotations) and accessing the metrics
through the management web interface.
