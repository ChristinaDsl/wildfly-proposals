== Implementation Plan

== Test Plan

This minor upgrade does not introduce any changes that requires new tests in WildFly.

The main changes (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/383[#383], https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/404[#404] and https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/386[#386]) are tested by the MicroProfile Config TCK.

* Run the WildFly integration basic test suite and checks there are no failures related to MicroProfle Config tests.
* Run the `microprofile-tck/config` module from WildFly integration test suite and checks that there are no failures.
  * Some tests that relates to the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/446[inconsistent behaviour for empty/missing config property (#446)] are excluded as smallrye-config implementation does not pass the TCK tests that are challenged by this issue.

== Community Documentation

* No community documentation is required for this upgrade
