== Overview

MicroProfile 3.0 has been released without any upgrade to the MicroProfile Config specification which remains at 1.3.
WildFly already integrates this version and uses smallrye-config 1.3.6 which is the latest version of smallrye-config that supports this version (smallrye-config 1.3.7 is more recent but challenges the MP Config 3.0 TCK related to the handling of empty property config).

To ensure that WildFly properly supports Eclipse MicroProfile Config for applications deployed in WildFly, we must verify that WildFly passes the MicroProfile Config TCK.

This RFE covers inclusion of the MicroProfile Config TCK in WildFly integration test suite.

=== Affected Projects or Components

The MicroProfile Config TCK will be run as submodule of the existing https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tree/master/testsuite/integration/microprofile-tck[`microprofile-tck` module of WildFly integration testsuite].

== Requirements

* Run the Eclipse MicroProfile Config TCK without failures

== Implementation Plan

* Add a `config` children module to the `microprofile-tck` module with setup and configuration to https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/tck/running_the_tck.asciidoc[run the MicroProfile Config TCK].

== Test Plan

* Run the `microprofile-tck/config` module from WildFly integration test suite and checks that there are no failures.
* Run the WilFly basic integration test suite and check that all tests related to MicroProfile Config pass (from the `org.wildfly.test.integration.microprofile.config.smallrye` package).

== Community Documentation

No community documentation is required to setup and run the MicroProfile Config TCK in WildFly
