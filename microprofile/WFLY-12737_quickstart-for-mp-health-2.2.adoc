== Overview

This RFE provides a new quickstart and guide for
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/tree/2.2[MicroProfile Health 2.2] use in WildFly /
JBoss EAP. The example will cover all basic functionalities of MicroProfile Health 2.2,
namely: liveness and readiness checks, the basic usage of the `HealthCheckResponseBuilder`,
and the inclusion of user specific data in the health check responses.
