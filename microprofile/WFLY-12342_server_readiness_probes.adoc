== Overview

MicroProfile Health 2.0 introduced a readiness health check.
WFLY-12228 added support for MicroProfile Health 2.0 without enhancing the readiness health check.

This means that the readiness probe always return UP by default (as long as the microprofile-health-smallrye is installed).

This RFE enhances it with 3 probes (that are part of the https://github.com/jboss-container-images/jboss-eap-modules/blob/251f422c97e1bcd3625f57295bc79973193482a6/os-eap-probes/2.0/added/probes/probe/eap/dmr.py#L23[EAP readiness probe script]):

* `server-status` - returns UP when the server-state is `running`
* `boot-errors` - return UP if there are no boot-errors
* `deployment-status` - returns UP if status for all deployments is OK

Once this RFE is done, we could simplify the EAP readiness probe script by replacing its various DMR checks by a single check to `/subsystem=microprofile-health-smallrye:check-ready` (or a HTTP call to `http://:9990/health/ready`).

=== Related Issues

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EAP7-1322[EAP7-1322]

=== Dev Contacts

* mailto:{email}[{author}]

=== QE Contacts

* TBD

=== Testing By

[X] QE

=== Affected Projects or Components

* This RFE impacts the `microprofile-health-smallrye` extension provided by WildFly
* Once done, it can be used by Kubernetes/Openshift to configure their readiness probe

== Requirements

* Add 3 readiness health checks to MicroProfile readiness probe:
** `server-status` - returns UP when the server-state is `running`
** `boot-errors` - return UP when there are no boot-errors
** `deployment-status` - returns UP when status for all deployments is OK

== Non-Requirements

* The MicroProfile Health subsystem is not supported in domain mode.

== Implementation Plan

* Update `org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.health.HealthReporterService` to add these 3 `HealthCheck` probes to the HealthReporter's `readinessChecks`.
* These 3 checks will execute a local DMR operation to determine their status.

A call to `/subsystem=microprofile-health-smallrye:check-ready` would aggregates results from these 3 probes:

            }
        ]
    }
}

== Community Documentation

The feature will be documented in WildFly Admin Guide (in its MicroProfile Health section) to specify that server readiness incorporates these 3 checks (in addition to any readiness check contributed by the deployments)
