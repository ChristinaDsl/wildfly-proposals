== Overview

WildFly is providing MicroProfile Health 1.0 for applications deployed in WildFly.

MicroProfile 3.0 has been released with a new major version for MicroProfile Health 2.0.1 that contains new features and breaking changes as described in its https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/releases/tag/2.0.1[release notes].

=== Affected Projects or Components

The implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile Health is provided by https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-health[smallrye-health].

smallrye-health uses CDI to discover all health check probes and provides a `SmallryeHeathReporter` that is `@ApplicationScope`-d.

WildFly extensions are not using CDI and the health probes must be available even when there is no deployed application.
The microprofile-health-smallrye will provide its own "reporter" that aggreated health checks procecures when applications are deployed/undeployed.


== Requirements

* Support Eclipse MicroProfile Health 2.0.1 for applications deployed in WildFly.
* Provide two additional HTTP endpoints `/health/live` and `/health/ready` to check exclusively liveness checks probes and readiness check probes.
* Provide two additional management operations `:check-live` and `:check-ready` to check exclusively liveness checks probes and readiness check probes.
* Repurpose the existing HTTP endpoint `/health` and `:check` operation to check *all* check probes (both liveness and readiness probes)
* Provides two management attributes to specify the global status when no readiness or liveness probes are defined. This allows applications to report `DOWN` until their probes verify that the application is ready/live. By default, these attributes will report `UP`.

== Non Requirements

* The integration of the health HTTP endpoints or operations in EAP or WildFly probes for Kubernetes is out of scope of this feature. It will be tracked in a separate https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CLOUD-3326[CLOUD-3326] issue.

== Implementation Plan

* Add dependencies to `io.smallrye:smallrye-health-2.0` and `org.eclipse.microprofile.health:microprofile-health-api:2.0` artifacts
* Modify the HealthContextService to expose additional HTTP endpoints `/health/live` and `/health/ready`.
* Modify the subsystem to provide additional methods `check-readiness` and `check-live` to check exclusively resp. the readiness and liveness probes.

=== Subsystem description

The subsystem has 2 additional attributes:

* `empty-readiness-checks-status` (`UP` by default) - Defines the global status returned by the `/health/ready` HTTP endpoint and `:check-ready` operation if no readiness probes have been registered.
* `empty-liveness-checks-status` (`UP` by default) - Defines the global status returned by the `/health/live` HTTP endpoint and `:check-live` operation if no readiness probes have been registered.

The `/health` HTTP endpoint and `:check` operation that checks both readiness and liveness probes also take into account these 2 attributes.

== Test Plan

* Update the `testsuite/integration/microprofile-tck/health` test suite to ensure that WildFly is passing the MicroProfile Health Check 2.0 TCK.

== Community Documentation

The feature is documented in WildFly Admin Guide in the MicroProfile Health section.
