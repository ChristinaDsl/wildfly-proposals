== Overview

In order to improve Observability of WildFly on OpenShift, WildFly needs to expose health check probes
so that the container can query whether WildFly and its deployed applications are healthy or not.

This will be implemented by supporting Eclipse MicroProfile Health 1.0 for applications deployed in WildFly.
The integration uses the smallrye-health component to provide the MicroProfile Health implementation.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-10711[WFLY-10711]

=== Related Issues

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EAP7-1029[EAP7-1029]
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CLOUD-2730[CLOUD-2730] - Implement EAP Health Check so that it can be consumed by OpenShift Console
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-10522[WFLY-10522] - MicroProfile Config extension for WildFly.
** There is no direct relation between MicroProfile Health and MicroProfile Config API but there should be consistency in their extensions (subsystem names, etc.)

=== Affected Projects or Components

The implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile Health is provided by https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-health[smallrye-health].

smallrye-health uses CDI to discover all health check probes and provides a `SmallryeHeathReporter`.
WildFly extensions are not using CDI and smallrye-health will have to be enhanced so that its `SmallryeHeathReporter` can
also be used by adding/removing health check probes manually.

=== Other Interested Projects

* A https://github.com/jmesnil/wildfly-microprofile-health[prototype of a WildFly extension] for MicroProfile Health was developed during the development of MicroProfile Health 1.0.

== Requirements

* Support Eclipse MicroProfile Health 1.0 for applications deployed in WildFly.
* Provide a management runtime operation to check the health of the application server and its deployed applications. The result of the runtime operation
  will be the DMR representation of the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/blob/1.0/spec/src/main/asciidoc/protocol-wireformat.adoc#appendix-b-json-payload-specification[MicroProfile Health JSON payload]
* Provide an HTTP endpoint for the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/blob/1.0/spec/src/main/asciidoc/protocol-wireformat.adoc[health wireformat].
  It requires the presence of the WildFly https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-capabilities/blob/master/org/wildfly/management/http-interface/capability.adoc[HTTP management interface capability]
* The HTTP endpoint is global to the server: it aggregates health check probes from *all deployments*.
* Secure access to the HTTP endpoint must be configurable.

== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Support drilldown of the HTTP endpoint (e.g. to be able to query the health of individual deployment, e.g. `/health/deploymentA`)
* Provide a WildFly management API so that other extensions can define health check probes that taken into account
  by the HTTP endpoint (this is out of scope of this proposal but the design of the new extension must not preclude to
  provide such an API at a later point).

== Non-Requirements

* MicroProfile Health 1.0 only provides a "liveness" probe (as defined by https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/#define-a-liveness-command[Kubernetes]).
__A Readiness probe is not covered by this proposal__.

== Implementation Plan

* Add dependencies to `io.smallrye:smallrye-health` and `org.eclipse.microprofile.health:microprofile-health-api:1.0` artifacts
* Add a new `microprofile-health-smallrye` extension to provide Health support for deployments.
* Provide a Undertow handler that exposes the optional health HTTP endpoint `/health` on WildFly `management-http` interface.

=== Subsystem description

The subsystem will be named `microprofile-health-smallrye`.

The subsystem contains child resources.

The subsystem has 1 attribute:

* `security-enabled` (`true` by default) - if security is enabled, the HTTP client must be authenticated to query the HTTP health endpoint.

The subsystem defines 1 runtime operation:

* `check` whose result is the DMR representation of the Health Check JSON payload.
  The management operation outcome will always be `success`. The _outcome of the health check_ is provided
  by the `outcome` property on the operation's `result`:

----
  /subsystem=microprofile-health-smallrye:check
  {
      "outcome" => "success",
      "result" => {
          "outcome" => "UP",
          "checks" => [{
              "name" => "random",
              "state" => "UP",
              "data" => {"foo" => "bar"}
          }]
      }
  }
----

If the global outcome is `UP`, the result's `outcome` will be `UP`, otherwise it will be `DOWN`.

The subsystem will install at runtime a HTTP endpoint `/health` on the `management-http` interface to provide
the MicroProfile Health Check endpoint.

If security is enabled, the HTTP client must be authenticated (otherwise, the server will reply with a
  `401 NOT AUTHORIZED` response).

----
curl -v --digest  -u admin:adminpwd http://localhost:9990/health
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 79
< Content-Type: application/json
...
{"outcome":"UP","checks":[{"name":"random","state":"UP","data":{"foo":"bar"}}]}
----

If security is disabled, the HTTP client does not need to be authenticated:

----
curl -v http://localhost:9990/health
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Length: 79
< Content-Type: application/json
...
{"outcome":"UP","checks":[{"name":"random","state":"UP","data":{"foo":"bar"}}]}
----

== Test Plan

* smallrye-health component is passing the MicroProfile Health TCK during its release process.
* WildFly integration test suite will be enhanced with tests that deploys Java archives with configurable
  health checks probes and asserts that the individual outcome of the probes affects the global
  outcome returned by the HTTP endpoint.

== Community Documentation

The feature will be documented in WildFly Admin Guide (in a new MicroProfile Health section).

There will no developer guide for this feature as there is nothing specific to WildFly for users
wanting to provide Health Check probes with their applications.
