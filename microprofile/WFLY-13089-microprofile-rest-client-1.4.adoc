== Overview

=== Affected Projects or Components:

* WildFly
* RESTEasy

== Requirements

* RESTEasy provides an implementation of Microprofile REST Client 1.4.0 version
** The only relevant change comparing to version 1.3.x is the requirement to support CDI injection in ClientHeadersFactory class
** The optional JAXRS injection (@Context) support in ClientHeadersFactory class is not going to be provided
* Existing RESTEasy functionalities are not affected by the addition (except for MP tests enforcing old MP spec behaviors, if any)

=== Test Plan

Build and run RESTEasy testsuite, which pulls the MP REST Client TCK in a dedicated testsuite submodule.

=== Testing By

[ ] Engineering

[x] QE

== Community Documentation

Documentations is going to be provided as an update of the existing RESTEasy component documentation (https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/3.10.0.Final/userguide/html_single/index.html#MicroProfile_Rest_Client).
