== Overview

We are proposing here to define a new script in docs/examples/enable-microprofile.cli
The script is an “example” script to be applied on default standalone configurations. 

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-13129

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* The script is packaged in the galleon-pack maven module. It is a default package installed when WildFly is installed.
* Installation path is _<JBOSS_HOME>/docs/examples/enable-microprofile.cli_.
* To launch the script: _bin/jboss-cli.sh --file=docs/examples/enable-microprofile.cli_
* When run, the script updates a given standalone configuration. By default it applies to standalone.xml. Use _-Dconfig=<standalone-full.xml|standalone-ha.xml|standalone-full-ha.xml>_
to select another standalone configuration.
* The script informs the user with high level information on the modifications it applies to the configuration it is updating.
* The script is expected to adapt to the differences that exist between various standalone configurations.
* The script detects that a microprofile subsystem is already present in the config and skips it. 
* The script secures the configuration using elytron security domain ApplicationDomain, http-authentication-factory and sasl-authentication-factory for items present in default configurations:
** core-service/management
*** access=identity security-domain=ManagementDomain
*** management-interface=http-interface http-upgrade.sasl-authentication-factory=management-sasl-authentication
*** management-interface=http-interface http-authentication-factory=management-http-authentication
** http-remoting-connector sasl-authentication-factory=application-sasl-authentication
** undertow 
*** application-security-domain=other security-domain=ApplicationDomain
** ejb3/application-security-domain=other security-domain=ApplicationDomain
** batch-jberet security-domain=ApplicationDomain
** messaging-activemq/server=default elytron-domain=ApplicationDomain (full only)
* The script remove the security subsystem
* The script remove the management ManagementRealm. NB: the script doesn’t touch the ApplicationRealm (used by http-invoker).
* Add Microprofile subsystems and extensions (only if the subsystem doesn't already exist)
** microprofile-openapi-smallrye
** microprofile-jwt-smallrye
** microprofile-fault-tolerance-smallrye
* The script fails if any of its operations can’t be successfully applied (JBOSS CLI behavior).

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

NONE

=== Non-Requirements

* The script is not supposed to be applied on top of custom standalone configurations.
* The script doesn't support domain/host configurations.

== Future Works

* Introduce an http-authentication-factory to be used by the http-invoker.
```
<http-authentication-factory name="application-http-authentication" http-server-mechanism-factory="global" security-domain="ApplicationDomain">
  <mechanism-configuration>
    <mechanism mechanism-name="BASIC">
      <mechanism-realm realm-name="Application Realm"/>
    </mechanism>
 </mechanism-configuration>
</http-authentication-factory>
```
* Reduce the ApplicationRealm to only offer support for SSL.

== Test Plan

* New tests to validate that the script can be applied to 4 standalone configurations: 
standalone.xml, standalone.ha.xml,standalone-full.xml,standalone-full-ha.xml
* New test to validate that the script fails if applied twice.
* Evolve testsuite/microprofile tests with an execution based on patched standalone.xml 

== Community Documentation

* Document how to apply the script to standalone configurations.

== Release Notes Content

New example CLI script to evolve standalone configurations to use microprofile subsystems.
