== Overview


MicroProfile 3.0 provides a major version of OpenTracing 1.3.0 that introduces breaking changes in both the Java API and REST specification.
This component upgrade also covers inclusion of the MicroProfile Opentracing TCK (both API & Rest) in WildFly integration test suite.

=== Affected Projects or Components

The MicroProfile OpenTracing TCK will be run as submodule of the existing https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tree/master/testsuite/integration/microprofile-tck[`microprofile-tck` module of WildFly integration testsuite].

=== Other Interested Projects

== Requirements

* Upgrade MicroProfile Opentracing 1.3.0
* Run any OpenTracing test in WildFly integration test suite
** tests may require changes as this major version has breaking changes.
* Run the Eclipse MicroProfile OpenTracing TCK without failures

=== Hard Requirements

N/A

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

N/A

=== Non-Requirements

This component upgrade will *not* change the code used to expose WildFly subsystems opentracing. This will be addressed in a subsequent issue.

== Implementation Plan

* Upgrade MicroProfile OpenTracing 1.3.0 artifacts and corresponding smallrye-metrics artifacts
* Setup and configuration to https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/blob/master/tck/running_the_tck.asciidoc[run the MicroProfile Config TCK] to run the rest-client part of the OpenTracing TCK.

== Test Plan

* Run the (updated) WildFly integration basic test suite and checks there are no failures related to opentracing tests.
* Run the `microprofile-tck/opentracing` module from WildFly integration test suite and checks that there are no failures.

== Community Documentation

* Community documentation for the `microprofile-opentracing-smallrye` subsystem in the admin guide needs to be updated to version 1.3.
* No community documentation is required to setup and run the MicroProfile OpenTracing TCK in WildFly.
