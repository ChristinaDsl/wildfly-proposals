== Overview

This RFE provides a new quickstart and guide for MicroProfile OpenTracing 1.3 use in
WildFly / JBoss EAP. The example will cover all basic functionalities of MicroProfile
OpenTracing 1.3, namely: default tracing of the REST endpoints, explicit instrumentation
with `@Traced` annotation, injection of `io.opentracing.Tracer`, and browsing collected
spans in Jaeger running in Docker container.
