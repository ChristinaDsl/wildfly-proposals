== Overview

This enhancement proposes to add support for https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-1.1.2/microprofile-openapi-spec.html[Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI 1.1] to WildFly by integrating the implementation from https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-open-api[SmallRye].
This spec provides a unified Java API for producing documentation that complies with the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/3.0.2/versions/3.0.2.md[OpenAPI v3 specification].

An MicroProfile OpenAPI subsystem exposes an HTTP GET `/openapi` endpoint that returns an OpenAPI v3 compliant document (in YAML or JSON format) containing documentation of the RESTful services of an application.

=== Affected Projects or Components

The SmallRye implementation of the MicroProfile OpenAPI specification is already integrated by the following projects:

* https://thorntail.io/[Thorntail] via the https://github.com/thorntail/thorntail/tree/master/fractions/microprofile/microprofile-openapi[microprofile-openapi fraction].
** General migration documentation from ThornTail is tracked by https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-12749[WFLY-12749]
* https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] via the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/tree/master/extensions/smallrye-openapi[smallrye-openapi extension].

These integrations will heavily inform, though not dictate, the corresponding integration into WildFly.


=== Other Interested Projects

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Create an MicroProfile OpenAPI galleon layer containing the MP Open API feature encapsulated by a new MicroProfile OpenAPI subsystem.
** Should depend on MicroProfile Config and JAX-RS (and their dependencies)
** N.B. New modules to be included in WF:
*** MicroProfile OpenAPI subsystem module
*** io.smallrye:smallrye-open-api
*** org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi:microprofile-openapi-api
*** com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-yaml
** Subsystem will be included in the default standalone-openshift.xml feature pack.
* The microprofile-openapi spec module must be exposed to web deployments
* The `/openapi` endpoint shall be registered relative to the root of the virtual host associated with the deployment.
** N.B. The `/openapi` endpoint is intended for a public interface, not a management interface, as with the `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints.
** This places a superficial constraint of a single application per host (see subsequent section re: multiple deployments)
** In the event a web deployment uses a given host for which another deployment has already registered an `/openapi` endpoint, we will:
... Log a warning.
... Skip OpenAPI model generation for that deployment.
* All WildFly/SmallRye specific configuration will be obtained via MicroProfile Config using the properties prefixed with `mp.openapi.extensions`.
** Consequently, the microprofile-openapi subsystem should have an empty management model.
* Support YAML and JSON for both input (static/pre-generated OpenAPI document) and output formats.
* MicroProfile OpenAPI TCK must pass

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Optional features of the specification:
** Multiple deployments:
*** If a container allows multiple deployments, the specification expects the `/openapi` endpoint to return the logical union of the documented services for all applications in the runtime. See: https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-1.1.2/microprofile-openapi-spec.html#_multiple_applications
**** Initially, we will limit multiple deployment support to a single deployment per host (for a given endpoint). i.e. each deployment, for which the OpenAPI endpoint is enabled, must either use a distinct host, or a distinct endpoint path (if a given virtual host is associated with multiple deployments).
**** Merging (and more interestingly, unmerging on undeploy) OpenAPI models for all applications deployed to a given host.
***** Consider for a future enhancement
** HTTPS transport for the `/openapi` endpoint.
*** If the server/host of a given application defines an HTTPS listener, we will allow it, but not require it.
*** Additionally, if the Undertow server/host associated with the application does not define an HTTP endpoint (as required by the spec), we should log a WARN message.
** The MicroProfile OpenAPI specification suggests, but does not require, the use of a `format=JSON` or `format=YAML` parameter for the `/openapi` endpoint, used to define content type of the resulting document, in lieu of an `Accept` header.
*** This is very reasonable, and is simple enough to do.  See: https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-1.1.2/microprofile-openapi-spec.html#_query_parameters
* Use a `mp.openapi.extensions.enabled` property to disable OpenAPI documentation globally (via mp-config subsystem) or per-application (e.g. /META-INF/mp-config.properties).
** Provides a parameterizable means of disabling OpenAPI documentation in specific environments (e.g. prod vs dev)
** Provides a mechanism to control which application associated with a given virtual host should generate an MicroProfile OpenAPI model.
* Use a `mp.openapi.extensions.path` property to customize the path of the OpenAPI endpoint.
** Provides a means for generating OpenAPI documentation for multiple applications associated with the same virtual host.
** Potentially useful to support legacy OpenAPI tooling (e.g. `/swagger`)
** Analogous to the `quarkus.smallrye-openapi.path` property in Quarkus.
* Use a `mp.openapi.extensions.servers.relative` property to configure whether auto-generated Server records should be absolute or relative.  At a minimum, Server records are necessary to ensure, in the presence of a non-root context path, that consumers of an OpenAPI can construct valid URLs to REST services relative to the host of the OpenAPI endpoint.  See: https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-1.1.2/microprofile-openapi-spec.html#_context_root_behavior
** When relative (i.e. true), the generated record will contain the context path of the deployment
** When absolute (i.e. false), generated records will include all hosts/ports at which the given deployment is accessible.
* Allow optional authentication/authorization constraints for the `/openapi` endpoint.
** Consider for a future enhancement
* Add an optional endpoint for browsing OpenAPI documentation via SwaggerUI (e.g. https://quarkus.io/guides/openapi-swaggerui-guide).
** Consider for a future enhancement

=== Non-Requirements

* The MicroProfile OpenAPI specification does not require support for i18n of the OpenAPI document (e.g. via an Accept-Language header), though this would be a reasonable subsequent enhancement.  See: https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-1.1.2/microprofile-openapi-spec.html#_internationalization
* The MicroProfile OpenAPI specification does not require support for validating the generated OpenAPI model, though this is a reasonable subsequent enhancement. A number of third-party validator exist and could be leveraged for such a feature.  See: https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-1.1.2/microprofile-openapi-spec.html#_validation
* The MicroProfile OpenAPI specification does not require support for https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)].  See: https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-open-api-1.1.2/microprofile-openapi-spec.html#_cross_origin_resource_sharing_cors

== Test Plan

* Basic subsystem unit tests
* Add the microprofile-tck tests to the MicroProfile TCK testsuite in WildFly.
* Integration tests should cover vendor specific behavior, not covered by the TCK tests, including:
** Ensuring that services deployed using a non-root context path are documented with the correct `server` elements.
** Any multi-deployment or multi-module deployment behavior, e.g. `mp.openapi.extensions.enabled`
** Alternate OpenAPI endpoint registration according to `mp.openapi.extensions.path`
** Fetching JSON vs YAML documentation via `format` parameter
** Loading JSON vs YAML static OpenAPI documentation

== Community Documentation

* Document how to add the microprofile-openapi subsystem to WildFly
* Document any WildFly specific `mp.openapi.extensions.*` configuration.
* Summarize how a user would:
** Provide a custom bootstrap of the OpenApiDocument model
** Contribute to the OpenApiDocument model via OpenAPI annotations.
** Register an OASFilter.
* Add quickstart application to WildFly quickstarts.

== Release Note Content

Add support for standardized documentation of RESTful web services via the MicroProfile OpenAPI 1.1 specification.
