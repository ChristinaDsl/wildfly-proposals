== Overview

MicroProfile 3.0 provides a major version of Metrics 2.0.1 that introduces breaking changes in both the Java API and REST specification.

This component upgrade also covers inclusion of the MicroProfile Metrics TCK (both API & Rest) in WildFly integration test suite.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-12294[WFLY-12294]

=== Related Issues

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EAP7-1146[EAP7-1146] - Transition EAP Metrics to support MicroProfile Metrics 2.0.1

=== Testing By

* [X] Engineering

=== Affected Projects or Components

The MicroProfile Metrics TCK will be run as submodule of the existing https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tree/master/testsuite/integration/microprofile-tck[`microprofile-tck` module of WildFly integration testsuite].

== Requirements

* Upgrade MicroProfile Metrics 2.0.1
* Run any metrics test in WildFly integration test suite
** tests may require changes as this major version has breaking changes.
* Run the Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics TCK without failures

== Non-Requirements

* This component upgrade will *not* change the code used to expose WildFly subsystems metrics (that uses prometheus client to collect and expose the data). This will be addressed in a subsequent issue.

== Implementation Plan

* Upgrade MicroProfile Metrics 2.0.1 artifacts and corresponding smallrye-metrics artifacts
* Add a `metrics` children module to the `microprofile-tck` module with setup and configuration to https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/blob/master/tck/running_the_tck.asciidoc[run the MicroProfile Config TCK].

== Test Plan

* Run the (updated) WildFly integration basic test suite and checks there are no failures related to metrics tests.
* Run the `microprofile-tck/metrics` module from WildFly integration test suite and checks that there are no failures.

== Community Documentation

* Community documentation for the `microprofile-metrics-smallrye` subsystem in the admin guide does not require any changes.
* No community documentation is required to setup and run the MicroProfile Metrics TCK in WildFly.
