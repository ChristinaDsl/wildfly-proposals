== Overview

Historically, we used to have a 'microprofile' layer spec aggregating all MicroProfile (further as MP) specs.
At that moment it only contained config, health and metrics which got eventually renamed
to 'observability' by https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-11774[WFLY-11774] (no RFE there).

With the introduction of new the specs such as MP Fault Tolerance, MP OpenAPI, etc. we want to
reintroduce the 'microprofile-platform' layer spec which contains all available MP specs in the server.

The following is a configuration example of the WildFly bootable JAR Maven plugin to provision a server with the
microprofile-platform layer:

* New 'microprofile-platform' Galleon layer is available for provisioning.

== Implementation Plan

No implementation coordination required.

== Test Plan

The test coverage of the Galleon layer added by this proposal is divided in two main groups:

1. Testing the Galleon layer provisioning.
This testing is done by https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/testsuite/layers/src/test/java/org/jboss/as/test/layers/LayersTestCase.java[LayersTestCase].
The testsuite will be modified to add a new server provisioned with this layer in isolation and with this layer combined with all the layers.
For each kind of provisioning, this test does the following:

.. Verifies the provisioned modules are the expected ones.
.. Verifies the provisioned server starts successfully.

2. Execution of WildFly tests related to the feature provisioned by this layer.
Reuse the existing tests available on the WildFly test suite, which are directly testing this layer functionalities,
and execute them on a server installation provisioned with this layer:

.. by the `testsuite/integration/basic` which provisions this layer and runs subset of MP tests from basic suite with it
.. by the `testsuite/integration/microprofile` test module which contains MP integration tests

Tests requiring components not provisioned by layers in the test server are excluded, e.g. one requiring EJB or security.


== Community Documentation

Description of the layer is added in the documentation as part of the implementation PR.

== Release Note Content

WildFly 21 introduces a new 'microprofile-platform' Galleon layer for provisioning. It provisions all specifications available in WildFly.
