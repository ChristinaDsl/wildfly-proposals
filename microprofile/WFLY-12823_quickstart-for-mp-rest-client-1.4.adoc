== Overview

This RFE provides a new quickstart and guide for MicroProfile REST client 1.4 use in
WildFly / JBoss EAP. The example will cover all basic functionalities of MicroProfile
REST Client 1.4, namely: definitions of REST client interfaces, definitions of custom
exception mappers, CDI injection of the client interfaces, and programmatic lookup of
the client interfaces.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* individual steps that the users will go through:
** deploy the server application providing a REST API
** create a model JSON class used to consume JSONs from the server API
** create a simple REST client interface utilizing the above model class
** configuration of the REST client in the `@RegisterRestClient` annotation
** injection of the REST client interface with the `@RestClient` qualifier
** configuration of the REST client through the MicroProfile Config properties
in the microprofile-config.properties file
** custom configuration keys defined in the `@RegisterRestClient` annotation
** programmatic lookup of REST client through `RestClientBuilder`
** Asynchronous requests demonstration with the `CompletionStage` return value
** create a custom `ResponseExceptionMapper` provider and register it with
`@RegisterProvider` annotation

=== Non-Requirements

* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client/blob/1.4.0/spec/src/main/asciidoc/async.asciidoc#asyncinvocationinterceptors[AsyncInvocationInterceptors]
* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client/blob/1.4.0/spec/src/main/asciidoc/ssl.asciidoc[SSL configuration]

== Test Plan

* The quickstart will have
http://arquillian.org/guides/getting_started/?utm_source=cta#write_an_arquillian_test[Arquillian]
tests verifying the responses codes from the
exposed endpoints as well as the returned JSON objects. The endpoints will be
invoked through the JAX-RS client (resteasy-client test dependency).

== Community Documentation

Covered by the quickstart README file in https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.
