== Overview


MicroProfile 3.1 provided a minor upgrade for MicroProfile Metrics 2.1. However this version introduced a regression and a 2.2 version was released shortly after to fix this regression.
This component upgrade will integrate https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/releases/tag/2.2[MicroProfile Metrics 2.2].
This component upgrade also covers the upgrade of smallrye-metrics 2.3.0 that implements MicroProfile Metrics 2.2.0

== Requirements

* Upgrade MicroProfile Metrics to 2.2.1
* Upgrade smallrye-metrics to 2.3.2
* Run any MicroProfile Metrics test in WildFly integration test suite
* Run the Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics TCK without failures
* After reviewing https://github.com/thorntail/thorntail/tree/master/testsuite/testsuite-microprofile-metrics[tests from Thorntail test suite that relates to MicroProfile Metrics]; there are no behaviour that is not already covered by WildFly test suite or MicroProfile Metrics TCK. No tests from Thorntail will be backported.

== Non-Requirements

* Using non-reusable metrics with same name across subdeployments of the same EAP deployments is not supported.
* Using non-reusable metrics with same name across multiple deployments is not supported.
  *  https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/architecture.adoc#usage-of-microprofile-metrics-in-application-servers-with-multiple-applications[The recommendation for multiple applications] can however be used instead.

== Implementation Plan

== Test Plan

* Add https://github.com/thorntail/thorntail/tree/master/testsuite/testsuite-microprofile-metrics[tests from Thorntail test suite that relates to MicroProfile Metrics] which is not already covered by the MicroProfile TCK or WildFly integration test suite. These new test cases will be added to WildFly basic ntegration test suite
* Run the WildFly integration basic test suite and checks there are no failures related to MicroProfle Metrics tests.
* Run the `microprofile-tck/metrics` module from WildFly integration test suite and checks that there are no failures.

== Community Documentation

* No community documentation is required for this upgrade
