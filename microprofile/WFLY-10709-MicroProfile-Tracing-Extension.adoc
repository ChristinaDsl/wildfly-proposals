== Overview

In order to improve Observability of applications deployed in WildFly it would be beneficial to provide
transparent tracing of Java EE components via automatic initialization of a tracer (Jaeger) plus a set
of instrumentation libraries for components commonly used in Java EE applications, such as JAX-RS and CDI.

This will be implemented by supporting Eclipse MicroProfile OpenTracing 1.1 for applications deployed in WildFly.
The integration uses the `smallrye-opentracing` component to provide the MicroProfile OpenTracing implementation.

For WildFly 14, this shall be marked as "Tech Preview", to get community feedback before committing to a stable API.
Notably, this first version lacks any configuration option following WildFly's standard management model, as this is
something that will likely change before a stable version.

Jaeger is composed by:

* the Jaeger Client, which is the Java library responsible for sending spans to an Agent or Collector. This is added as dependency to applications being deployed into WildFly as part of this proposal
* Jaeger Agent, which is a daemon typically running on `localhost` acting as a buffer, accepting spans via UDP and sending them to a remote Collector
* Jaeger Collector, which is a backend service connected to a permanent storage for writing, receiving spans either from Agents or directly from applications via HTTP
* Jaeger Query / UI, which is a frontend service connected to the permanent storage for reading, providing a query and web user interface

By default, the Jaeger Client sends spans to an Agent via UDP, close to a "fire and forget" mode. Due to the nature of UDP, the Client isn't aware that the Agent received the submitted packet containing the span. Similarly, if the cluster of Jaeger Collectors isn't available, the Jaeger Client won't break.

Logging options are provided at the Client side (see [`JAEGER_REPORTER_LOG_SPANS`](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java/blob/master/jaeger-core/README.md)), as well as Agent and Collector under `debug` level, for positive confirmation about the flow of spans from the Client up to the Collector.

=== Affected Projects or Components

The implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile OpenTracing is provided by https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-opentracing[smallrye-opentracing].

=== Other Interested Projects

* None

== Requirements

* Support https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing/blob/1.1/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-opentracing.asciidoc[Eclipse MicroProfile OpenTracing 1.1] for applications deployed in WildFly, including JAX-RS and CDI integration. Passing the TCK is required.
* Support a concrete tracer, such as Jaeger's
* Allow applications to supply their own tracers via `TracerResolver`
* Each individual application deployed (WAR) should have its own `Tracer` instance
* Each WAR within an EAR should be treated as an individual WAR, having their own `Tracer` instance

== Nice-to-Have Requirements

Items that are currently being considered for the next version of this feature:

* Enable/disable tracing on the entire server
* Enable/disable tracing on a per-deployment basis
* Configuration following WildFly's standard management model

== Non-Requirements

* None at this point

== Implementation Plan

* Add dependencies to `io.smallrye:smallrye-opentracing` artifacts, including its transitive dependencies (notably OpenTracing)
* Add dependencies to `io.jaegertracing:jaeger-client` artifacts, including its transitive dependencies
* Add a new `microprofile-opentracing-smallrye` extension to provide OpenTracing support for deployments.
* Provide a servlet context initializer to initialize Jaeger Tracer
* Provide the required filters to get SmallRye's JAX-RS integration working
* Provide the required CDI extensions and producers to get SmallRye's CDI integration working

== Test Plan

* `smallrye-opentracing` component is passing the MicroProfile OpenTracing TCK during its release process.
* WildFly integration test suite will be enhanced with tests that ensure applications getting deployed are able 
to be traced. Among possibly others, tests should cover that:
** A `Tracer` can be injected into managed beans
** Tracing can be disabled for specific endpoints/CDI beans by using the `@Traced` annotation
** Operation names can be customized by using the `@Traced` annotation

== Community Documentation

The feature will be documented in WildFly Admin Guide (in a new MicroProfile OpenTracing section).
