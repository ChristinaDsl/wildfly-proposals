== Overview

Jakarta Server Faces (JSF) defines an MVC framework for building user interfaces for web applications, including UI components, state management, event handing, input validation, page navigation, and support for internationalization and accessibility.

The goal of this feature is to supply a https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/#_layers[Galleon layer] which will be responsible for providing the WildFly JSF subsystem.

The following is a configuration example of the WildFly bootable JAR Maven plugin to provision a server with the `jsf` layer:

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* The Galleon layer must provide a servlet container and configure the WildFly JSF subsystem.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

N/A

=== Non-Requirements

* The JSF layer does not expose a management interface. That means, it doesn't need to depend on any security subsystems.

== Test Plan

The test coverage of the Galleon layer added by this proposal is divided in two main groups:

. Testing the Galleon layer provisioning. This testing is done by https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/testsuite/layers/src/test/java/org/jboss/as/test/layers/LayersTestCase.java[LayersTestCase]. The testsuite will be modified to add a new server provisioned with this layer in isolation and with this layer combined with all the layers. For each kind of provisioning, this test does the following:

.. Verifies the provisioned modules are the expected ones.
.. Verifies the provisioned server starts successfully.

. Execution of WildFly tests related to the feature provisioned by this layer. Reuse the existing tests available on the WildFly test suite, which are directly testing this layer functionalities, and execute them on a server installation provisioned with this layer.

== Community Documentation

Community documentation plan is adding the layer to https://docs.wildfly.org/20/Admin_Guide.html#wildfly-galleon-layers[WildFly Galleon layers] in the section it belongs to.

== Release Note Content

A Galleon layer to give support to Jakarta Server Faces (JSF).
