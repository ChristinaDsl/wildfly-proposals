== Overview

This issue has two parts.
First, it brings Mojarra 2.3.3 into WildFly.
In addition, it introduces support for a switch between JSF 2.2.x (EE 7) and JSF 2.3.x (EE 8) for the sake of certification.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue:

* {issue-base-url}/WFLY-6462[WFLY-6462]

=== Related Issues:

* {issue-base-url}/EAP7-893[EAP7-893]

=== Dev Contacts:

* mailto:fjuma@redhat.com[Farah Juma]

=== QE Contacts:

* TBD

=== Affected Projects or Components:

* WildFly
* JSF

== Requirements

* By default, WildFly will use the JSF 2.2.x API and implementation.
* By default, WildFly will be JSF 2.2 compliant, so that it can pass the EE 7 TCK.
* WildFly will be able to opt-in to use the JSF 2.3.x API and implementation through the use of the ee8.preview.mode switch.

=== Test Plan

We should be executing the JSF 2.2 TCK when running in EE 7 mode (the default mode).
We should be executing the JSF 2.3 TCK when running in EE 8 mode.
