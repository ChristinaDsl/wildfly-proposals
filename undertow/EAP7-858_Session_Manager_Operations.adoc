== Overview

This feature is to add additional features to the management model to allow additional operations to be
performed on the web session manager.

== Requirements

This will be implemented as additional operations under the `deployment=*/subsystem=undertow` management model address.

The extra operations implemented will be:


:: invalidate-session(sessionId)

Invalidates the provided session id

:: list-sessions()

Lists all session id's

:: list-session-attribute-names(sessionId)

Lists all attribute names for the given session

:: list-session-attributes(sessionId)

Returns an object that maps attribute names to an attributes string representation

:: get-session-attribute(sessionId, attributeName)

Returns the string representation of the given attribute

:: get-session-last-accessed-time

Gets the session last accessed time in ISO-8601 format

:: get-session-last-accessed-time-millis

Gets the session last accessed time in milliseconds since unix epoch

:: get-session-creation-time

Gets the session creation time in ISO-8601 format

:: get-session-creation-time-millis

Gets the session creation time in milliseconds since unix epoch

=== Test Plan

A test will be added to the web test suite that will make the following assertions:

- Deploy a web deployment that can create a session
- Invoke `list-sessions` and verify that the list is empty
- Store current time C1
- Make an invocation on the web app that results in session creation
- Store current time C2
- Invoke `list-sessions` and verify that the list contains recently created session
- Invoke `get-session-creation-time` and `get-session-creation-time-millis`, and verify both results are between C1 and C2 and they match
- Invoke `get-session-last-accessed-time` and `get-session-last-accessed-time-millis`, and verify both results are same as for `get-session-creation-time` and `get-session-creation-time-millis`
- Invoke `list-session-attribute-names` and check that result list contains expected items
- Invoke `list-session-attributes` and check that result map contains expected `name=value` pairs
- Store current time A1
- Make an invocation to store a string attribute in the session
- Store current time A2
- Invoke `get-session-last-accessed-time` and `get-session-last-accessed-time-millis`, and verify both results are between A1 and A2 and they match
- Invoke `get-session-attribute` and make sure result is as expected
- Invoke `invalidate-session` to invalidate created session
- Invoke `list-sessions` to check that there is no session active anymore

We should put also some simple negative tests:

- Deploy a web deployment that can create a session
- Invoke `list-session-attribute-names`, `list-session-attributes`, `get-session-attribute` on non-existing session and check that operation fails due to the session could not be found
- Invoke `invalidate-session` on non-existing session and check that operation succeeds (we simply ignore wrong session ID in this case)
- Make an invocation on the web app that results in session creation
- Invoke `get-session-attribute` on existing session although with non-existing attribute name and assert that session is successful and result is 'undefined'
- Invoke `invalidate-session` to invalidate created session
