== Overview

This issue has two parts.
Firstly it brings Undertow 2.0/Servlet 4.0 into Wildfly.
Secondly, it introduces support for switch between Servlet 3.1 (EE7) and Servlet 4.0 (EE 8) for the sake of certification.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue:

* {issue-base-url}/WFLY-6456[WFLY-6456]

=== Related Issues:

* {issue-base-url}/EAP7-902[EAP7-902]

=== Affected Projects or Components:

* WildFly
* Undertow

== Requirements

* WildFly will use Undertow 2.0 implementation
* Wildfly will, by default, be Servlet 3.1 compliant, so that it can pass EE 7 TCKs
* Wildfly will be able to opt-in into Servlet 4.0 API through the use of the ee8.preview.mode feature flag

=== Test Plan

The Servlet 3.1 TCK will be run as normal as part of EE7 certification. The EE8 TCK will also be run
however as Servlet 4.0 will initially be considered tech preview it is not necessary to pass this 100%
until we are aiming to achieve EE8 certification, although every effort will be made to do so.
