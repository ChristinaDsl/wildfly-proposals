== Overview

Currently access logs can only be written as plain text. This plain text will be written to either a specific file or
logged via the normal logging facilities. It's desirable for a log aggregator to accept formatted log messages. Using
JSON seems to be the most common format.

* OpenShift

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* The output must be well formed JSON.
* The formatted message must be on a single line.
* The output must be able to write to standard out. This is required for OpenShift.
* A label of some sort, whether it's hard-coded or user defined, must be added to the output. This allows filtering
  log messages of different types.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Allow the user to choose which attributes are added to the JSON.
* The ability to add custom key/value (meta-data) pairs to the output.
    ** This would be something like `{ "@version" : "1" }`

=== Non-Requirements

* Messages will only be written to `stdout` at this point.
* Messages cannot go through a log manager. The message itself needs to be structured
  which would not be the case if going through a log manager.
* Messages written to the console for domain servers will not remove the
  [server-name] prefix from standard out.

== Implementation Plan

The implementation will be done in WildFly and we should not need to do anything to Undertow itself.

A new `setting` resource will be introduced. The resource will be
`/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/host=default-host/setting=console-access-log`. This allows
no changes to the current access logging and allows the console access logging to be used independently
from the file or standard logging access logging.

== Test Plan

Standard unit and integration tests will be used.
