== Overview

This feature is to add support for version 1 of the proxy protcol as defined at
http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt. This will be supported via a new attribute on Undertow
listeners called `proxy-protocol`.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements


This will be implemented as an attribute called `proxy-protocol` under each of the listeners. If this is set to true
then the listener will be wrapped by the Undertow proxy protocol implementation. This wrapper reads the proxy protocol
header from the stream, before handing off the connection to the normal listener implementation.

This information will be used by any part of the request processing that requests the remote clients IP address,
including access logging and calls to `javax.servlet.ServletRequest#getRemoteAddr()`.

This will be supported for HTTP, HTTPS, but not AJP.


=== Non-Requirements

This does not involve adding support for acting as a load balanacer using the proxy protocol. The proxy protocol is
connection based rather than request based, so there would be basically zero code reuse between the existing proxy
and any java implementation of a proxy.

=== Test Plan

Tests will be created in the Wildfly test suite that adds both a HTTP and HTTPS listener with this attribute set to
true. Using a raw socket a proxy protocol connection will be established, and a HTTP request sent. A servlet will be
installed in Wildfly that sends back the reported remote address, and these will be compared to what was sent in the
proxy protocol header.

Core comprehensive tests for proxy protocol support are present in the Undertow test suite, the WildFly test suite
will just contain smoke tests to make sure the configuration is working as expected.
