== Overview

The goal of this feature is to add an option to mark all cookies that are set on a secure connection with the
secure attribute. This means that a cookie that is set over a secure connection will never be sent over an unsecure
connection.

== Requirements

This will be implemented in the form of a handler that can be configured as an `expression-handler` in the management
model, or in `undertow-handlers.conf`. If this handler is present and a connection is marked as secure (either due
to HTTPS being in use or due to it being marked as secure through configuration) then all cookies will have their
`secure` attribute overriden to be true.

== Test Plan

The tests for this should reside in the Undertow test suite, and have already been developed as part of the upstream work.

https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow/blob/master/core/src/test/java/io/undertow/server/handlers/SecureCookieHandlerTestCase.java

This test checks what happens when a cookie is set over a HTTP and HTTPS connection, and verifies that the HTTPS
connection results in a cookie marked as being secure.
