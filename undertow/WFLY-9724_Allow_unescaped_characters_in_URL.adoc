== Overview

This feature is to add an additional option into the Undertow subsystem configuration to allow unescaped
characters to be processed directly.

== Requirements

This will be implemented as an additional listener option under the Undertow subsystem called
`allow-unescaped-characters-in-url`. This will be false by default for security reasons, however if it is set to true
then this will let Undertow process unescaped non ASCII characters in the URL.

=== Test Plan

A new test will be created that adds a new listener with this option enabled. A request with UTF-8 in the URL
will be sent to both the new listener and the current listener that is part of the standard configuration, it
is expected that the new listener will accept it, and process the request, while the existing listener will reject
it with a 400 response.
