== Overview

When it comes to SameSite cookie attributes, currently Undertow conforms to the
"Cookies: HTTP State Management Mechanism" draft proposed in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-02[draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-02],
at August 2017.

Since early 2019, three more drafts were submitted and changes in the attribute were made.
The current version can be viewed in draft https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-05[5],
valid until August 2020. The main change is that `"None"` was added as a SameSite option, and set
by default if SameSite attribute contained any value other than `"Strict"` and `"Lax"`.

We also have new changes proposed in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00[Incrementally
Better Cookies]. Mainly, make any cookie that does not have a `SameSite` attribute to be
treated as it had a `SameSite=Lax` attribute. This forces developers that do not
want to have same site cookies to add a `SameSite=None` attribute, currently not
supported by Undertow. Plus, according to the document, any `SameSite=None` cookie
must have the `Secure` attribute as well, which is another rule that developers
must comply with.

Even though "Incrementally Better Cookies" is a draft, browsers are adhering to those changes, with highlight for
Google Chrome https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592[latest changes].

Undertow needs to be updated accordingly to become compatible with those changes, and
to make it easy for the developer to add a `SameSite` cookie attribute to their cookies
without changing application code.

== Requirements

Support the SameSite value `"None"`, that currently is not supported by Undertow.

Also, given that now cookies that lack the `SameSite` attribute are treated as
`SameSite="Lax"` by default, a predicate handler that adds a `SameSite` attribute to cookies
is needed so that users can easily conform to the new changes without having to edit
their application code.

=== Hard Requirements

We have three hard requirements for this:

- `CookieImpl.setSameSiteMode()` must be able to parse and accept `"None"` as a parameter
- implement a predicate handler `io.undertow.server.handlers.SameSiteCookieHandler`, named `samesite-cookie` that has the parameters:
* `mode`: the SameSite Cookie mode (should be one of `Strict`, `Lax` or `None`)
* `cookie-pattern`: optional parameter that accepts a pattern for the cookie name
* `case-sensitive`: optional parameter that indicates if the pattern is case-sensitive. Defaults to `true`.
This predicate handler adds the `SameSite=mode` attribute to the cookies that match `cookie-pattern` (or to all cookies if
`cookie-pattern` is not specified). Notice that the matching will conform to the value of `case-sensitive`, i.e., will be case sensitive
only is `case-sensitive` is either `true` or left unspecified.

Also, because Cookies with `SameSite=None` that are not Secure are rejected in the new draft, add `Secure` by default when `None` is used.
This could be disabled via another optional parameter in the handler:

* `add-secure-for-none`: defaults to `true`. Adds `Secure` attribute to the cookie when `mode` is `None`.


=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

We can add a check that verifies if the browser is compatible with the new `"None"` value of `SameSite`
attribute. If the browser is not, it will mistakenly interpret the default value in a different way
causing applications to malfunction.

The check will be enabled by default, but can be disabled via an optional parameter
in the handler:

* `enable-client-checker`: enable the client checker that prevents `samesite-cookie`
handler from setting the `SameSite="None"` attribute when dealing with incompatible agents.
This parameter is optional and is set to `true` by default.

//== Implementation Plan
////
Delete if not needed. The intent is if you have a complex feature which can 
not be delivered all in one go to suggest the strategy. If your feature falls 
into this category, please mention the Release Coordinators on the pull 
request so they are aware.
////
== Test Plan

== Community Documentation
Currently, handlers are not listed in the WildFly documentation. We will update the Undertow community
documentation with that feature.
////
Generally a feature should have documentation as part of the PR to wildfly master, or as a follow up PR if the feature is in wildfly-core. In some cases though the documentation belongs more in a component, or does not need any documentation. Indicate which of these will happen.
////
== Release Note Content
Added support for `SameSite="None"` cookie attributes and support for a new handler
that sets `SameSite` attributes on cookies specified by a cookie name pattern. With
this handler, web developers can remain compliant with latest changes in some browsers
without editing the application code.
////
Draft verbiage for up to a few sentences on the feature for inclusion in the
Release Note blog article for the release that first includes this feature. 
Example article: http://wildfly.org/news/2018/08/30/WildFly14-Final-Released/.
This content will be edited, so there is no need to make it perfect or discuss
what release it appears in.  "See Overview" is acceptable if the overview is
suitable. For simple features best covered as an item in a bullet-point list 
of features containing a few words on each, use "Bullet point: <The few words>"
