== Overview

Currently when a reverse proxy sends a request to a backend server it informs the backend server
of the details of the HTTP connection using non-standard X-Forwarded-* headers. A new RFC has
been proposed to standardise this using a new 'Forwarded' header. This feature will allow all fields
from the 'Forwarded' header to be processed, and the relevant data used to populate the fields
of the Undertow HttpServerExchange (and by extension the Servlet HttpServletRequest).

== Requirements

A handler will be implemented to handle all fields of the Forwarded header.

The relevant fields are:

by::
If host is not specified this sets the desintation address of the exchange
for::
This sends the source address on the exchange
host::
Replaces the 'Host' header in the request header map, and the destination address on the exchange
proto::
This sets the request scheme on the exchange

For now this will just be implemented as a handler and must be enabled via an 'expression-filter'. Even
though it is tempting to just use the existing proxy-address-forwarding attribute this is a security risk,
as front end servers may not know to strip this header and let it through, allowing IP address spoofing.

== Test Plan

Testing should be part of the Undertow test suite, as there is no additional functionality provided by WildFly there
is not real need for downstream tests.

An existing test case already exists done as part of the upstream work:

https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow/blob/master/core/src/test/java/io/undertow/server/handlers/ForwardedHandlerTestCase.java

It tests all of the above fields, with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, as well as logical and unknown hosts.
