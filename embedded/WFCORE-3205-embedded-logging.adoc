== Overview

The embedded server should not require the JBoss Log Manager to be used. A user should be able to use their
own log manager/logging configuration. The server itself uses JBoss Logging which works with several log
managers. The embedded server should honor the log manager being used.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-3205[WFCORE-3205]

=== Dev Contacts

* mailto:{email}[{author}]

=== QE Contacts

* mailto:nziakova@redhat.com[Nikoleta Ziakova]

=== Affected Projects or Components

* Any consumer of the WildFly Embedded Server
* Offline CLI
* The new provisioning tool
* Arquillian Embedded

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Needs to work in:
** Offline CLI
** In the provisioning tool
** Any environment created by a user; an executable main method, custom user configuration, maven/gradle plugin, etc.

* This should also work with any log manager supported by JBoss Logging.
** JUL
** JBoss Log Manager
** Logback
** Log4j (1.x)
** log4j2

* The logging subsystem should be configurable, however it should not override the current user configuration.

* The logging subsystem itself should contain the logic on how the JBoss Log Manager will be used. If the
logging subsystem is not present then the embedded server should not make assumptions that the JBoss Log
Manager will be available or even configurable.

* We should not be initializing the JBoss Log Manager, e.g. the `logging.properties` should not be processed.

* Offline CLI requires the `--stdout=echo` to log messages to the console. This _must_ work as
  http://wildfly.org/news/2015/03/13/Offline-CLI/[documented].

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Not requiring the user to specify the `org.jboss.logging.provider` system property for the log manager being used
** This _might_ not be an issue but it should be checked. Initial testing did show some messages going through the
   JBoss Log Manager, though making the subsystem not execute runtime steps may resolve this issue.

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

Add a new test suite for embedded servers.
