== Overview

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-3999[WFCORE-3999]

=== Related Issues

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EAP7-1079[EAP7-1079]
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-10711[WFLY-10711] - Implement Health Check so that it can be consumed by OpenShift Console
** The HTTP endpoint provided by the MicroProfile Health Check will be exposed by a HTTP handler on
    WildFly HTTP management interface
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-1742[WFCORE-1742] - Allow registering a custom handler for management interface
** This feature allows to add ResourceManager to the WildFly HTTP management interface. It is targeting static resources such
    as files and have limitations that make it not a good fit to provide a HTTP API endpoint.

== Requirements

With https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-1742[WFCORE-1742], it is possible to add "resources" to the HTTP management interface through the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/server/mgmt/domain/ExtensibleHttpManagement.java[`ExtensibleHttpManagement`] interface.

However this requires to provide a https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/undertow/server/handlers/resource/ResourceManager.java[ResourceManager] (from Undertow API) object that represents the resource.
This interface is meant to represent static resources (such as file) and does not map well to exposing a "REST" kind of API.
It requires to provide cache metadata (etag, cache) that may not be relevant for a HTTP API.

It also automatically enables redirection (e.g. `/` to `/index.html`) without possibility to disable it.

For some HTTP API such as the one required by MicroProfile Health Check (a GET on `/management/health`), it would be better to be able to pass a https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/undertow/server/HttpHandler.java[HttpHandler] instead of a `ResourceManager` to have more flexibility/simplicity to provide management HTTP API.

One of the concern when WFCORE-1742 was created was that that feature exposed Undertow API.
This is already the case with `ResourceManager` and this enhancement would only add exposition to the `HttpHandler` interface (in particular, the `HttpServerExchange` interface which is at the root of Undertow is already exposed by the `ResourceManager`).

In `ExtensibleHttpManagement`, we add a single method:

[code,java]
====
    /**
     * Add a context for a HTTP management handler.
     * @param contextName the name of the context. Cannot be {@code null} or empty
     * @param requiresSecurity {@code true} if the management handler requires security.
     * @param managementHandler HTTP management handler. Cannot be {@code null}
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if either parameter is invalid
     * @throws IllegalStateException if there is already a context present named the same as {@code contextName}, either
     *                               added via this interface or otherwise
     */
    void addManagementHandler(String contextName, boolean requiresSecurity, HttpHandler managementHandler);

====

This method complements the existing `addStaticContext(String contextName, boolean requiresSecurity, ResourceManager resourceManager))`.

There is no need to add a corresponding remove method as the existing one `removeContext(String contextName)` can be used.

The value of `requiresSecurity` specified the security behaviour of the management HttpHandler:

* if it is `false`, unauthenticated access is _allowed_ and there is no security authentication or authorization.
* if it is `true`, unauthenticated access is _disallowed_ and security authentication and authorization are performed. This implies that the application
  must have configured an user in its management realm in order to allow authenticated access to the HTTP handler.

=== Non-Requirements

These are items that are explicitly not required.

* This feature is experimental and unsupported. It is not considered a tech preview. Extensions that uses this feature may be subject to changes
  during the lifetime of the EAP minor release that includes this feature.

== Test Plan

* Extend https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/blob/master/testsuite/standalone/src/test/java/org/jboss/as/test/integration/management/http/CustomManagementContextTestCase.java[CustomManagementContextTestCase] to test a dynamic `HttpHandler`
in addition to the static ResourceManager that was tested in the context of WFCORE-1742.

== Community Documentation

* As this feature is experimental, it will not be documented in https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/_admin-guide/management-api/The_HTTP_management_API.adoc[The HTTP management API].
Documentation will be updated if and when this feature status changes to Tech Preview or supported.
