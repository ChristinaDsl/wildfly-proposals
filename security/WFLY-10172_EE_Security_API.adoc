== Overview

This issue is about integrating the Java EE Security RI in order to become Java EE8 compliant.

== Requirements=

=== Hard Requirements

The reference implementation for the Java EE security API will be integrated into WildFly. This will be done by creating
a new subsystem (`ee-security`) that will perform any integration work required.

As the RI depends on CDI and JASPIC API's only at present no configuration or Elytron specific integration is planned.
Users of this API will simply inherit whatever JASPIC config WildFly is configured to use, either Elytron or the legacy
security subsystem.

At some point we may wish to provide additional authentication mechanisms or identity stores, however that is outside the
scope of this feature and not something that we should be holding up Java EE8 over.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

This work does not depend on Elytron support for JASPIC. As the RI uses standard JASPIC APIs it can be implemented
regardless of the underlying JASPIC implementation.

== Test Plan

The TCK provides extensive testing of this feature.
