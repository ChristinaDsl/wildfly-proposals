== Overview

Add support for building MR JARs to the JBoss parent POM for Maven builds, which all JBoss projects can seamlessly utilize.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-10178[WFLY-10178]

=== Affected Projects or Components

* WildFly Common
* JBoss Marshalling
* JBoss Modules
* JBoss Log Manager

=== Other Interested Projects

* All projects using ``jboss-parent`` which need MR JAR support

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Provide a means to automatically build MR (multi-release) JARs on demand as specified by http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/238[JEP 238]
* Provide a simple, Maven-style structure for source overlay directories
** For example, ``src/main/java9``, ``src/main/java10``, etc.
** Each source overlay directory must correspond to an output directory e.g. ``META-INF/versions/9``, ``META-INF/versions/10``, etc.
* Add ``Multi-Release`` to the JAR manifest when building MR JARs
* Only enable MR JAR functionality when source overlay directories are present
* Provide a means to automatically run unit tests on each supported JDK
* Allow each layer to automatically depend on the layers below it
* Do not require any additional configuration beyond upgrading the parent POM
* Allow the "baseline" Java version to be Java 8 or any available Java version later than Java 8
** For example, a project may require Java 10 as its minimum version; in this case, ``src/main/java`` would contain Java 10 sources
* Allow overlay Java versions to be Java 9 or any available Java version later than Java 9
** For example, a project requiring Java 10 as its minimum version may have a Java 11 ``src/main/java11`` overlay
* Only require overlay source directories for Java versions beyond the baseline version
* Do not interfere with ``maven-compiler-plugin`` customized configurations
* Provide basic developer documentation in support of the feature

=== Nice-to-Have/Optional Requirements

* Include overlay sources in the source JAR
** This is not presently supported in any reasonable way with the ``maven-source-plugin`` so either that plugin would have to be enhanced, or a custom plugin written to perform this task
* Include a mechanism to prevent artifact deployment unless all layers are unit tested during the same build

=== Non-Requirements

* It is not a requirement to support building variations of projects with a JDK whose version is earlier than the latest supported JDK of the project
* It is not a requirement at this time to support multiple layers of test source directories (though this may be revisited in a future iteration)
* It is not a requirement to provide any special support for JavaDoc
** By spec, only the baseline directory may contain API elements, i.e. it is not allowed to introduce classes which only "exist" when running under certain JDK versions
* It is not a requirement to provide any special support for changes in a project's minimum version
** For example, if a Java 8 project with a ``java9`` overlay were to change to require Java 9 as a minimum version, it is the developer's responsibility to flatten the Java 9 sources over the old Java 8 sources

== Test Plan

* Build above projects with new parent POM in place of existing per-project configuration; verify output
