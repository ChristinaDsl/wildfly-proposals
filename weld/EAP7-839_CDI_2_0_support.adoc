== Overview

This issue has two parts.
Firstly it brings Weld 3.x/CDI 2.0 into Wildfly.
Secondly, it introduces support for switch between CDI 1.2 (EE7) and CDI 2.0 (EE 8) for the sake of certification.

=== Affected Projects or Components:

* WildFly
* Weld

== Requirements

* WildFly will use Weld 3.x implementation
* Wildfly will, by default, be CDI 1.2 compliant, so that it can pass EE 7 TCKs
* Wildfly will be able to opt-in into CDI 2.0 API through agreed switch option

=== Test Plan

We should be executing TCK 1.2 with EE 7 mode (default) and TCK 2.0 with EE 8 mode.
Weld has an easy way of executing both TCKs with given WildFly binary, it is also set to automatically enable EE 8 mode on WildFly for TCK 2.0 testing.
Furthermore, even now, those TCKs are automatically executed in Jenkins amongst all other TCK TS.
