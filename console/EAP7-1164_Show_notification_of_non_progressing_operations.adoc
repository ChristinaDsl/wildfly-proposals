== Overview

It may happen the Server or Host controller is performing some management operation in background and acquired an exclusive lock (writing to the xml file for example) on a resource. 

There is an operation `/core-service=management/service=management-operations:find-non-progressing-operation` to detect if any active operation that acquired the exclusive and is running longer than 15s is categorized as a non progressing operation, it would help the user to display a global notification on the header, if there is a non progressing operation.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HAL-527

== Requirements

The notification of the non progressing operation is to be displayed besides the "Reload Required" area in the top line of the header.

To find out if there is any non progressing operation, make a call to  `/core-service=management/service=management-operations:find-non-progressing-operation` on each running server (and hosts in domain mode) at a configurable period of time.

Two new settings attributes are required to control this periodic behavior:

* Poll: To enable or disable the polling mechanism.
* Poll Time: The amount of time in seconds in the range of 5 to 300.

These settings attributes will be part of the settings dialog and are persited as cookies in the browser system, similar to the already existing Settings.
