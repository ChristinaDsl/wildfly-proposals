== Overview

Currently HAL displays the active management operations in Runtime -> Server (Standalone) and Runtime -> Host (Domain), for domain mode, it shows the active operations for each host and doesn't show the active operations for servers, also the user must open each host view to see the active operations.

To improve the use experience in domain mode, it would be better to show the active operations of hosts and servers in a central place.

This proposal is to add a "Management Operations" item in "Browse By" column, in domain mode, to show all active operations, this view will call the `/core-service=management/service=management-operations/active-operation=*:read-resource` of all running hosts and servers.

On Standalone mode, the current option in a drop down item on server column actually works, but for a common experience in standalone and domain mode, the "Management Operations" option in Standalone mode is to be available in the Monitor column.
