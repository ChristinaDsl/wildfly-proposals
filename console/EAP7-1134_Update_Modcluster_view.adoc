== Overview

Two new singleton resources are available in modcluster subsystem

load-provider=dynamic
load-provider=simple

The previous dynamic-load-provider=configuration is an alias to load-provider=dynamic. We should update modcluster configuration to use those two new singleton resources.

== Requirements

* Add the load-provider=dynamic as a primary level menu in a proxy view.
* Add the load-provider=simple as a primary level menu in a proxy view.
* They are mutually exclusive, each one will be a singleton form, and whenever one is added the other is removed.
* The load-provider=dynamic contains sub-resources (custom-load-metric and load-metric) they will be added as primary level menu item.
* The custom-load-metric and load-metric pane will show an alert if the parent load-provider=dynamic doesn't exist.
* On the custom-load-metric and load-metric view, the add and remove buttons are disabled if there is no load-provider=dynamic resource created.

== Test Plan
