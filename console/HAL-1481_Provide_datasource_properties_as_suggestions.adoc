== Overview

The /subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver resource provides runtime information about the allowed datasource properties for Datasource and XADatasource implementations, it was implemented by EAP7-940.
Once the jdbc-driver is added with `driver-datasource-class-name` or `driver-xa-datasource-class-name`, HAL may provide those properties as suggestions when user edits the connection properties.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HAL-1481
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EAP7-966

=== Dev Contacts

* mailto:claudio@redhat.com[Claudio Miranda]

=== QE Contacts

* mailto:pjelinek@redhat.com[Pavel Jelinek]

=== Affected Projects or Components

* HAL

== Requirements

For this feature to work in HAL, these are the requirements:

* The jdbc-driver must be created with driver-datasource-class-name or driver-xa-datasource-class-name attributes set, because they are required for the subsystem to list the datasource class properties.
* In domain mode, there should be a running server associated to the profile the user wants to edit, because the datasource properties is loaded from a running server.

=== Non-Requirements

* Driver deployment is not supported on the subsystem level.
* No required to work when editing in model browser, as it is a generic interface to interact with the domain model.

=== Hard Requirements

When user wants to edit the connection properties (datasource) or the datasource properties (xa datasource), the properties will be displayed as suggestions on the following screens:

* Wizard to create a new XA Datasource, on the "Properties" step.
* Editing a Datasource, on the connection tab, there is the connection properties
* Editing a XA Datasource, on the connection tab, there is the xa datasource properties

== Community Documentation

No need.
