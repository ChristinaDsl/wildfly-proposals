== Overview

When users wants to list the network open ports of a managed server, they can open HAL model browser and navigate to the socket-bindings and open each socket-binding to show the bound-port, however this is not a productive method.
This proposal is to list all bound ports and the socket-binding name on a preview pane per server.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/HAL-532
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EAP7-1156

=== Dev Contacts

* mailto:claudio@redhat.com[Claudio Miranda]

=== QE Contacts

== Requirements

To show the bound ports, the following operation is to be used.

`/socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=http:read-resource(include-runtime)`

* Show all bound ports of each socket-binding and its name.
* Show them in the server preview pane.
* Show the open ports when the server is in the following status: running, reload-required, restart-required
* Do not show while the server is starting, stopping or in suspended mode.
* Should work in domain and standalone mode.

=== Non-Requirements

There are services that doesn't register themselves with the socket-binding, as a consequence the socket is open but it is not displayed as bound, they will not be displayed in the "Opent Ports" preview. Currently `modcluster` is one service that doesn't register the socket-binding.

Deployed applications can open sockets and as it is not registered in the socket-binding, the ports will not be displayed in the Open Ports preview pane.

== Community Documentation

No need.
