== Overview

There is the /subsystem=microprofile-health-smallrye resource to configure and show the microprofile health checks from microprofile applications. It works only in standalone mode as domain mode is not supported yet (see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-10863[WFLY-10863]).
The configuration for microprofile-health has only one boolean attribute, then for the configuration section the Model Browser already takes care to let users change the attribute.
There is a check runtime operation to show the health checks and the global outcome as boolean value. HAL should display a preview with the last N checks and the global outcome, there also should be a specific "View" button to show all checks.

== Requirements

* No change in configuration section of microprofile-health, model browser already takes care of configuration as there is a single boolean attribute.
* The Monitor column on runtime view will have a microprofile-health option.
* The microprofile-health will display a preview pane with the following information: 
** outcome of the health check as an alert (green is UP, red is DOWN)
** display the last 10 health checks as an list of properties.
* There will be a "View" button for microprofile-health, this will open a dedicated view to show the global outcome and all health-checks as a list of properties.


== Non Requirements

* As domain mode is not supported on subsystem level, there will be no microprofile-health on HAL for domain mode.

== Test Plan

TBD

== Community Documentation

NA
