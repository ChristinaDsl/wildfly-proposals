== Requirements

* In runtime, the console shows also dicsonnected hosts which are no longer connected to the domain controller.
* There are actions to prune disconnected and expired hosts. These actions call the management operations `/core-service=management/host-connection=<host>:prune-disconnected` resp. `/core-service=management/host-connection=<host>:prune-expired`

== Test Plan

TBD
