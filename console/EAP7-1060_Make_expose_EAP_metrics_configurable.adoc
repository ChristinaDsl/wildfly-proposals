== Overview

This RFE is about to configure the attributes of the subsystem `microprofile-metrics-smallrye`.

The subsystem contains no child resources and two attributes:

* `security-enabled` (`true` by default) - if security is enabled, the HTTP client must be authenticated to query the HTTP endpoints.
* `exposed-subsystems` - a list of strings corresponding the name of subsystems that exposes their metrics in the HTTP endpoints.
