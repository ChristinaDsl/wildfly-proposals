== Requirements

Add conditional support for JavaMail 1.6.x This will be controlled by the `ee8.preview.mode` system property. If
the property is not present or not set to `true` JavaMail 1.5.x will be used instead.

Changes in JavaMail that affect api compatibility are

 ** https://github.com/javaee/javamail/issues/232[GH 232]	Update public API to use generics
 ** https://github.com/javaee/javamail/issues/226[GH 226]	MailSessionDefinition should use the Repeatable annotation for Java EE 8
