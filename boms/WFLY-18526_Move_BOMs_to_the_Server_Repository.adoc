== Overview

This proposal specifies the move of BOMs to the Server Repository, for both WildFly and JBoss EAP, which should prevent recurrent synchronization issues (e.g. WFLY-18043, WFLY-18155, WFLY-17879), and simplify maintenance and the WildFly/EAP release processes.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* The BOMs sources should be moved to the Server repository, and placed in a new /boms/user directory. The BOMs sources repository history should be included in such move.

* Any dependency on the BOMs source repository should be updated to depend instead on the directory /boms/user in the Server's source repository:
** WildFly Quickstarts GitHub Actions CI

* The following repositories should be archived after the first related Server release includes the BOMs sources:
** https://github.com/wildfly/boms
** https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-boms

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* N/A

=== Non-Requirements

* N/A

== Test Plan

* The BOMs Maven modules will be added to the server's Maven Project, and thus the BOMs building will be tested along any Server's build test.  identify and

== Community Documentation

* No community documentation reference to the BOMs source repository exists, requiring an update.

== Release Note Content

* The sources for WildFly/JBoss EAP BOMs builder are now included with the server sources, and may be found in the /boms/user directory.
