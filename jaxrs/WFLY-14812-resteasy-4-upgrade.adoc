== Overview

The RESTEasy project has made some structural changes and been updated to remove some old deprecated types which are
now part of the Jakarta EE RESTful Web Services specification. This upgrade also includes better support for Java 17.
It will also be the future for the Jakarta EE 9+ specifications.

=== Other Interested Projects

=== Relevant Installation Types
* [x] Traditional standalone server (unzipped or provisioned by Galleon)

* [x] Managed domain

* [x] OpenShift s2i

* [x] Bootable jar

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Deprecate the `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jaxrs` module
  ** This will be replaced by the following modules:
    *** `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-client`
    *** `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-client-api`
    *** `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-core`
    *** `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-core-spi`
* Remove the `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jettison-provider` module
* Remove the `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-yaml-provider` module
* The `StringConverter` will be removed in favor of the `ParamConverter`
* The RESTEasy async response will be removed and replaced with the async response from the specification.
* The GZIP interceptors have changed package names.
  ** The workaround for this will be to simply set the `resteasy.allowGzip` property to `true`
  ** The migration step will be to change the package from `org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.interceptors.encoding` to
     `org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.interceptors`
* Migration rules will need to be written.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

There are currently no plans to update the current testing except any changes needed for removing removed code. The
current tests should be enough to ensure backwards compatibility.

== Community Documentation

Community documentation will need to be updated to list the removed functionality.

== Release Note Content

RESTEasy has been upgraded in WildFly from the legacy 3.x to 4.x. If you're using the Jakarta RESTful Web Services API
you should not see any differences. However, if you use API's specific to RESTEasy these may have changed.

The module `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jaxrs` has been deprecated and replaced by `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-client-api`
and `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-core-spi`.

The `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jettison-provider` and `org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-yaml-provider` have been removed.
Jettison can be replaced either by the JSON-P/JSON-B provider or the Jackson 2 provider. There is currently no
replacement for a YAML provider.

Some examples are:

* `@Suspend` and `org.jboss.resteasy.spi.AsynchronousResponse` have been removed and replaced by Jakarta REST annotations.
* `StringConverter` replaced with `ParamConverter`
* `org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceInvoker` moved to `org.jboss.resteasy.spi.ResourceInvoker`
* GZIP interceptors have changed packages, `org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.interceptors.encoding` -> `org.jboss.resteasy.plugins.interceptors`
    ** The workaround is to set the `resteasy.allowGzip` parameter to `true`.

The following features have been added to 4.x:

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-1418[RESTEASY-1418]: RESTEasy should be able to provide trace information about request
* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RESTEASY-1905[RESTEASY-1905]: Asynch injection
