== Overview

This is about extending the support for async / reactive in RESTEasy beyond what's in JAX-RS 2.1.
In particular this includes:

* supporting RxJava(2) return types in resource methods, as well as any other custom reactive type through the implementation of the new interface AsyncResponseProvider (https://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/3.5.1.Final/javadocs/org/jboss/resteasy/spi/AsyncResponseProvider.html); the interfaces for such new resources are also going to work properly for building RESTEasy proxies
* providing an implementation of the JAX-RS 2.1 client RxInvoker (https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/ws/rs/client/RxInvoker.html) interface based in RxJava(2), effectively allowing usage of RxJava(2) library to compose JAX-RS client invocations
* supporting suspend/resume of JAX-RS filter processing through the new SuspendableContainerRequestContext (http://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/3.5.1.Final/javadocs/org/jboss/resteasy/core/interception/jaxrs/SuspendableContainerRequestContext.html) and SuspendableContainerResponseContext (http://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/3.5.1.Final/javadocs/org/jboss/resteasy/core/interception/jaxrs/SuspendableContainerResponseContext.html) interfaces.

When using reactive types with more than a single potential value (so basically streams), RESTEasy will support three different representation on the wire, dependending on the use of the new org.jboss.resteasy.annotations.Stream annotation on resources:

* no @Stream annotation on the resource method: Resteasy will collect every value until the stream is complete, then wrap them into a java.util.List entity and send to the client
* @Stream(Stream.MODE.GENERAL): This case uses a variant of the SSE format, modified to eliminate some restrictions inherent in SSE; in particular, certain delimiting characters in the data ('\r', '\n', and '\') are escaped so that arbitrary binary data can be transmitted; moreover the client will close, rather than automatically reconnect, at the end of the stream
* @Stream(Stream.MODE.RAW): In this case each value is written directly to the wire, without any formatting or delimiters, as it becomes available; this is most useful for values that can be cut in pieces, such as strings, bytes, buffers, etc., and then re-concatenated on the client side.

Since general streaming mode and SSE share minor variants of the same wire protocol, they are, modulo the SSE restriction to character data, interchangeable. As a consequence RESTEasy will make it possible for an SSE client to connect to a resource method that returns a Flowable or an Observable, and a FlowableRxInvoker (implementation of RxInvoker using RxJava(2) Flowable), for example, to connect to an SSE resource method.

=== Affected Projects or Components:

* WildFly
* RESTEasy

== Requirements

* The features included in this RFE will be supported as *Tech Preview* till futher notice
* The support for Reactive Streams types, for both client (RxInvoker) and server (AsyncResponseProvider) sides, will be available and enabled by default.
* The RxJava(2) implementation will live in a separate resteasy-rxjava2 module that will be available by default but disabled (optional) by default; the user will need to set a dependency to the org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-rxjava2 module to make use of the RxJava(2) integration.
* The resteasy-rxjava2 module will hence be treated as tech preview


=== Test Plan

The features are heavily tested in RESTEasy codebase. Successfully running the latest RESTEasy release' testsuite against target WildFly container will be required.


== Community Documentation

The documentation is coming with the release of the RESTEasy component that's bringing the feature in WildFly. In particular, most of the documentation is coming from this merged PR: https://github.com/resteasy/Resteasy/pull/1503/files#diff-ee23077b10c9a3678d072f7f0bb0ccf4
