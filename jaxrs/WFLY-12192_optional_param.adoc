== Overview

Currently, The parameter type supports the following construct (from RESTEasy document):

> The parameter type you inject into can be any primitive type, a String, or any Java object that has a constructor that takes a String parameter, or a static `valueOf` method that takes a String as a parameter.

This proposal is to support a series of `java.util.Optional` types as a wrapper object types. This will give users the ability to use optional typed parameters, and eliminate all null checks by using methods like `Optional.orElse()`.

Please note that `@PathParam` is an exception for which `Optional` is not available. The reason is that `Optional` for the `@PathParam` use case would just be a NO-OP, since an element of the path cannot be omitted.

[] QE

=== Affected Projects or Components:

* WildFly
* RESTEasy

== Requirements

* RESTEasy will offer a mechanism to support a series of `java.util.Optional` types as a wrapper object types. This will give users the ability to use optional typed parameters, and eliminate all null checks by using methods like `Optional.orElse()`.
* Default behavior won't change.
* WildFly will allow using the new RESTEasy functionality.

=== Test Plan

The tests for this feature will be stored in the RESTEasy testsuite.

=== Community Documentation

Documentation should be coming as part of the RESTEasy component documentation.
