== Overview

This is about providing an implementation of the Microprofile REST Client 1.3 spec; the latest 1.3.x available version should be consumed (currently https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client/releases/tag/1.3.2).

== Issue Metadata

=== QE Contacts:

* mailto:nziakova@redhat.com[Nikoleta Ziakova]

=== Affected Projects or Components:

* WildFly
* RESTEasy

== Requirements

* RESTEasy provides an implementation of the latest Microprofile REST Client 1.3 version (1.3.2 or later).
* Existing RESTEasy functionalities are not affected by the addition (except for MP tests enforcing old MP spec behaviors, if any)

=== Test Plan

Build and run RESTEasy testsuite, which pulls the MP REST Client TCK in a dedicated testsuite submodule.

== Community Documentation

Documentations should be coming as part of the RESTEasy component documentation.
