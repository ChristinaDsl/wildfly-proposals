== Overview

RESTEasy 6.2 is Jakarta REST 3.1 (Jakarta EE 10) compliant. The MicroProfile REST Client, MicroProfile REST Config
Sources and Spring were moved out of the project and into new projects in RESTEasy 5.x. This was due to the project
dependencies not being Jakarta EE 10 compliant.

One new module will be introduced for the `org.jboss.resteasy.microprofile:microprofile-config`.

Two new projects:

* https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-microprofile
* https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-spring

=== Relevant Installation Types
* [x] Traditional standalone server (unzipped or provisioned by Galleon)

* [x] Managed domain

* [x] OpenShift s2i

* [x] Bootable jar

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Replace the RESTEasy MicroProfile client in WildFly
* Do not change any runtime module names.
* Add the `org.jboss.resteasy.microprofile:microprofile-config` module.
* As part of the 5.x upgrade, WildFly Preview will be upgraded to RESTEasy 6.x for native Jakarta EE 9.1 support of
Jakarta RESTful Web Services.
* Quickstarts, especially for Spring, will require some changes. This needs to be done in conjunction with this change.
** The quickstarts that use Spring should change to include RESTEasy Spring in the deployment.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

The current test suite and Jakarta EE TCK should be sufficient for testing. The MicroProfile TCK is run as part of the
resteasy-microprofile project. RESTEasy itself runs against the Jakarta REST 3.1 TCK nightly and with each PR.

== Community Documentation

Community documentation will need to be updated to show the changes for the Maven group id's and artifact id's.

== Release Note Content

RESTEasy has migrated the Eclipse MicroProfile support out of RESTEasy core into a
https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-microprofile[new project]. Functionally nothing has changed. The only requirement
is a change to the Maven group id and artifact id required to use the MicroProfile REST Client and MicroProfile Config
sources.

RESTEasy Spring has been removed from WildFly. This was done as there is no current release of Spring which supports
the `jakarta` namespace change.
