== Overview
Previously we allowed a transaction timeout value of "0" to be set in the transaction subsystem, meaning "no transaction timeout".

After the WF 11 changes, we've stopped allowing that value to be set. This behavior should be restored, with "0" translating into some "very large" value.

The transaction team has indicated that using Integer.MAX_VALUE has historically exhibited problems, so a different, smaller-but-still-large value should be used in this case.

The purpose of the suggestion of the maximum timeout attribute would be to make this value configurable (also in the event where someone programmatically sets a timeout which might be problematic).

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* This attribute will be provided in the transaction with name of `maximum-timeout`, and it will default to `31536000`.
* The transaction timeout value will be used with this attribute if 0 is set. Also we should log an warn message if we
* set it to anything other than the value that the user requests and ensure it is in the documentation.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

* QE could run the cli command to set the transaction timeout to 0 and make sure it works. Also it will show the warn
* message that `The transaction timeout has been set to %s while the value is 0`.
