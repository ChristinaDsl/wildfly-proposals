== Overview

Distributable web applications are indicated by the use of the <distributable/> element within web.xml.
A distributable web application is one that is capable of passivating state to support the following scenarios:
* Extending the lifecycle of a web session beyond the size constraints of a single server, i.e. traditional passivation.
* Extending the lifecycle of a web session across the lifecycle of a single server, i.e. traditional clustering.

Currently, the configuration of a distributable web application is encapsulated within jboss-web.xml via the following elements:

<max-active-sessions/>:: Enables size-based session passivation, when distributed
<replication-config/>:: Defines replication behavior.  Inappropriately named when used for passivation.
<cache-name/>::: Overrides the backing cache-container and/or cache. By default, uses default cache of “web” cache-container
<replication-granularity/>::: SESSION (default) or ATTRIBUTE, i.e. coarse vs fine session → cache entry mapping

This configuration dates back to AS4, and suffers from several limitations:

* Default behavior of distributed session manager not explicitly defined
** Default cache-container hardcoded to “web”
** Routing behavior is fixed
** No mechanism to globally override default behavior
*** Must override per web application
* <cache-name/> is inadequate
** Used to build requirement name of backing Infinispan cache configuration
** Single value is a relic from JBoss Cache (EAP 4/5)
** Single element provides up to 2 values: cache-container + cache
*** e.g. <cache-name>foo</cache-name>
**** Use default cache of “foo” cache container
*** e.g. <cache-name>foo.bar</cache-name>
**** Use “bar” cache of “foo” cache container
* Hard coded routing cache configuration
** Created from default cache configuration of “web” cache container
* WFLY-5497 shared-session-config.xml lacks <distributable/>
** Currently, we always use distributed session manager, if loadable
* Default distributable SSO behavior is fixed
** Hardcoded to use default cache of "web" cache-container
* Missing ability to customize distributable SSO behavior per host (Undertow SSO) or per application security domain (Elyron SSO)

Additionally, the current configuration mechanism does not easily accommodate upcoming features:

* WFLY-5497 New distributed session manager implementation
** https://github.com/wildfly-clustering/wildfly-clustering-web-hotrod
** Need ability to specify which implementation to use
* WFLY-7719 Configurable routing strategies
* Configurable concurrency strategies

Proposal is to create a new subsystem that manages sets of session-management configuration (with a designated default), including:

* Which distributed session management implementation
* Implementation specific configuration, e.g. cache-container, cache, remote-cache-container, etc.
* Session distribution granularity (aka replication-granularity)
* Routing strategy

Deployments can use a named configuration, the default configuration, or define a deployment specific configuration.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Create new subsystem that defines:
** A set of distributable web session configurations, where one is designated the server-wide default.
** A set of distributable single sign-on configurations, where one is designated the server-wide default.
** Server-wide routing configuration
* Subsystem exposes implementations of org.wildfly.clustering.web.spi as capabilities.
* DUP for parsing a jboss-all.xml namespace that references a named distributable web session profile
* Deprecate jboss-web.xml <replication-config/>
* Support legacy <replication-config/> usage by generating an ad hoc distributable web session profile
* When subsystem is not defined, system should behave the same as it does currently.
* Add optimized default cache configurations for SSO and routing
* Add support for the following routing strategies:
** NONE - no route appended to session ID
** LOCAL - route of local node appended to session ID
** OWNER - route of primary owner appended to session ID (behaves as LOCAL for remote, local, invalidation, scattered caches)

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* DUPs for parsing a jboss-all.xml namespace that defines a deployment-specific distributable web session profile
* Allow per-server (i.e. Undertow server) session management defaults
* Allow per-host Undertow SSO management defaults
* Allow per-application security domain SSO management defaults


=== Non-Requirements

== Implementation Plan

. Enhance PersistentResourceXMLDescription to support logical grouping of child resources (WFCORE-3939)
. Create new subsystem (WFLY-5550)
. Wire Undertow to use SessionManagerFactory attachments if defined, or generate ad hoc SessionManagerFactory based on ReplicationConfig
. Deprecate <replication-config/> in jboss-web metadata
. Wire Undertow host SSO and application security domain resources to use configuration from distributable-web subsystem
. Enhance RouteLocator implementation to support all routing strategies (WFLY-6944)
. Add support for <distributable/> to shared-session configuration (WFLY-5497)
. Add support for session/sso management over hotrod (subsequent feature proposal)

== Test Plan

Test cases:

* Validate distributable web application behavior is consistent with WF13 when new subsystem is absent
* Validate distributable web application using default configuration
* Validate distributable web application using named configuration
* Validate distributable web application using ad hoc configuration
* Validate distributable web application using legacy <replication-config/>
* Validate each routing strategy works as advertised (these will be simple unit tests)

== Community Documentation

Community documentation will be updated to describe how to use this new subsystem to customize default distributed web session behavior.
