== Overview

EAP includes both an Infinispan and JGroups subsystems and accompanying modules.
EAP uses these subsystems to implement clustering, web session caching and replication and Hibernate 2nd-level caching.
While the subsystems are exposed in the domain model, user deployments have been up-to-now forbidden from using any of the `org.infinispan`/`org.jgroups` APIs.
One of the main motivations behind this was to enable upselling to the equivalent RHDG functionality via additional modules layered on top of an EAP installation.

This has a number of shortcomings:
since the introduction of the Runtimes bundle, there no longer is a business reason to prevent users from using the Infinispan/JGroups bits that are already provided by EAP.
The EAP clustering team already maintains the subsystems for its own purposes.
Being part of EAP ensures that these subsystems are kept up-to-date with all the evolutions/changes of the platform.
The duplication of modules and subsystems added by RHDG creates extra confusion and a usability hurdle, worsened by the divergence of the codebase and configuration/model between the two.
This proposal would allow users to officially be able to use the EAP Infinispan/JGroups subsystems and modules in their own deployments without requiring the installation of additional RHDG modules.

The following use-cases would be enabled:

* Explicit importing of the `org.infinispan.*` modules from the `jboss-deployment-structure.xml/MANIFEST.MF`
* Creation and use of custom caches in the Infinispan subsystem by user deployments

From an engineering perspective, this merely requires making the requisite infinispan modules public (they are currently private/unsupported). This includes:
* org.infinispan (embedded cache)
* org.infinispan.client.hotrod (client for remote infinispan server)
* org.infinispan.commons
RHDG support and engineering will provide support for all use-cases relating to the components mentioned above, excluding the subsystems which would continue to be handled by EAP clustering.

RHDG will provide documentation for the Infinispan API which can either be included in its modularized form or linked from the EAP documentation.

It is understood that EAP will only use productized builds of the Infinispan/JGroups components that have already received RHDG QE sign-off.

* `org.infinispan.client.hotrod` (client for remote infinispan server)
* `org.infinispan.commons`

== Test Plan

It is understood that EAP will only use productized builds of the Infinispan/JGroups components that have already received RHDG QE sign-off.

== Community Documentation

Upstream documentation demonstrates how to inject and use a Cache and references upstream docs.
For downstream, RHDG will provide documentation for the Infinispan API which can either be included in its modularized form or linked from the EAP documentation.

== Release Note Content

The Infinispan modules can now be used without a private usage warning.
