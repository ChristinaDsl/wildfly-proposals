== Overview

A new remote cache store configuration is established with schema and model.
Capabilities are provided for `RemoteCacheContainer` type (extends `BasicCacheContainer`).
Connection to the remote cluster could be secured using SSL.
I should be able to inject a hotrod client to connect to remote JDG cluster via @Resource JNDI injection.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* A remote-cache-container can be configured
* The remote-cache-container can be secured using SSL Context from Elytron subsystem
* `org.wildfly.clustering.infinispan.spi.RemoteCacheContainer` instances could be injected using `@Resource` injection

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Test cases are introduced in upstream testsuite

=== Non-Requirements

N/A

== Test Plan

QE could run the standard set of performance/failover/soak tests with clusterbench modification using
HotRod client injection to maintain the session data.
