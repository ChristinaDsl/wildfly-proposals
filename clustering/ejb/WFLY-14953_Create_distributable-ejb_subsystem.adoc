== Overview

The _undertow_ and _ejb3_ subsystems depend on certain abstractions provided by the clustering subsystems in order to support
clustered deployments.

Hard-coding clustering subsystem dependencies within the _ejb3_ subsystem creates a tight-coupling between
the subsystems in question, and also makes configuring the various dependencies (or plugging in alternative dependencies)
difficult. Defining a separate "configuration" subsystem to sit in between the _ejb3_ subsystem and the relevant clustering
subsystems simplifies configuration and provides a looser coupling between the subsystems.

The _distributable-web_ subsystem was introduced to provide decoupling between the _undertow_ subsystem and the relevant clustering
subsystems. The aim of the _distributable-ejb_ subsystem is to do the same for the _ejb3_ subsystem and the clustering abstractions
that it depends on.

There are at present four features provided by the _ejb3_ subsystem which depend on clustering abstractions:

* provision of cache factories, used to store stateful session bean sessions
* provision of client mappings registries, used to provide EJB client topology updates
* provision of singleton services, used to support singleton message-driven bean delivery groups
* provision of distributed timer management, used to support distributed EJB timers (future)

The _distributable-ejb_ subsystem will allow defining different backend providers of these abstractions, which may be configured
independently of the _ejb3_ subsystem.

Ultimately, the _distributable-ejb_ subsystem will provide providers for all four of the feature areas listed above.
But this issue will be restricted to the following scope:

* defining the _distributable-ejb_ subsystem
* defining a cache factory bean management provider for stateful session beans and integrating that provider into the _ejb3_ subsystem
* defining a client mappings registry provider for the EJB client and integrating that provider into the _ejb3_ subsystem

The remaining two features will be completed in separate RFEs:

** WFLY-7628 will address this for distributed timer management
** WFLY-15432 will address this for singleton service

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

The distributable-ejb subsystem:

* Must allow configuration of one or more named bean management providers
* Must identify a default bean management provider from those defined in the subsystem
* Must allow configuration of local and distributed providers for client mappings registries

The ejb3 subsystem:

* Must allow integration of cache factories with named bean management providers defined in the distributable-ejb
subsystem
* Must cause the default bean management provider to be used when a distributable cache factory does not specify a bean
management provider
* Must allow integration of client mappings registries of the EJB client remoting connector with the (single) client
mappings registry provider specified in the _distributable-ejb_ subsystem with the

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

The ability to allow overriding the default bean management provider for a single deployment is not a hard requirement,
but a nice-to-have.

=== Non-Requirements

== Backwards Compatibility

These changes affect backward compatability (c.f. legacy configuration of cache factories, passivation stores,
client mappings registries, etc)  in the sense that they introduce changes to the way the _ejb3_ subsystem
is configured with respect to definition of cache factory resources and client mappings entries.

=== cache factories

Prior to this RFE, non-passivating cache factories and passivating cache factories were configured as follows:
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:ejb3:10.0">
     ...
     <caches>
        <!-- a non-passivating cache factory -->
        <cache name="simple-cache"/>
        <!-- a passivating cache factory with its passivation store -->
        <cache name="distributable-cache" passivation-store="infinispan"/>
    </caches>
    ...
    <passivation-stores>
      <passivation-store name="infinispan" cache-container="ejb" max-sze="10000">
    </passivation-stores>
    ...
</subsystem>
----
With this RFE, the same cache factories are configured as follows:
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:ejb3:10.0">
     ...
     <caches>
        <!-- a non-passivating cache factory -->
        <simple-cache name="simple-cache"/>
        <!-- a passivating cache factory with its bean management provider -->
        <distributable-cache name="distributable-cache" bean-management="infinispan"/>
    </caches>
    ...
  </subsystem>
----
The bean management provider is now configured separately in the distributable-ejb subsystem:
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:distributable-ejb:1.0" default-bean-management="infinispan">
    <infinispan-bean-management name="infinispan" cache-container="ejb" cache="dist" max-size="10000"/>
    ...
</subsystem>
----

=== client mappings registries

Prior to this RFE, client mappings registries were configured as follows:
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:ejb3:10.0">
    ...
    <remote cluster="ejb" connectors="http-remoting-connector" thread-pool-name="default">
       <channel-creation-options>
            <option name="MAX_OUTBOUND_MESSAGES" value="1234" type="remoting"/>
       </channel-creation-options>
    </remote>
    ...
</subsystem>
----
Here, the "cluster" attribute identifies the group name of the infinispan cache backing the client mappings
registry, used to store  client mappings for this server. The implementation of the client mappings registry is
hard-wired into the _ejb3_ subsystem.

With this RFE, client mappings registries are configured as follows:
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:ejb3:10.0">
    ...
    <remote connectors="http-remoting-connector" thread-pool-name="default">
       <channel-creation-options>
            <option name="MAX_OUTBOUND_MESSAGES" value="1234" type="remoting"/>
       </channel-creation-options>
    </remote>
    ...
</subsystem>
----
The "cluster" attribute is now removed from the remote element of the _ejb3_ subsystem, and is now instead
specified in the client mappings registry element of the _distributable-ejb_ subsystem:
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:distributable-ejb:1.0" default-bean-management="infinispan">
    ...
    <infinispan-client-mappings-registry cache-container="ejb" cache="client-mappings"/>
</subsystem>
----

To ensure that legacy configurations (configurations written for _ejb3_ subsystem schema 9 or lower) still work with
a server incorporating this RFE, the legacy elements described above will be accepted as part of a valid configuration,
and legacy providers will be used to guarantee the same legacy functionality. The only restriction here is that
legacy cache factories and non-legacy cache factories, wether they be passivating or non-passivating, cannot both
use the same name.

=== Default Configuration

Here is an example of the way the new subsystem will look, for the case of specifying a bean management provider:
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:distributable-ejb:1.0" default-bean-management="infinispan">
    <infinispan-bean-management name="infinispan" cache-container="ejb" cache="dist" max-size="10"/>
</subsystem>
----
and here is its corresponding integration into the ejb3 subsystem:
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:ejb3:10.0">
     ...
     <caches>
        <simple-cache name="simple-cache"/>
        <distributable-cache name="distributable-cache" bean-management="infinispan"/>
    </caches>
    ...
 </subsystem>
----
Note that the distributable-cache element takes an optional bean-management attribute, which is a reference to
the bean management provider in the new subsystem. A similar arrangement will be used for client mappings registries.
When unspecified, the default-bean-management profile is used.

As before, for each EJB SFSB, the "@Cache" annotation (resp. deployment descriptor configuration) may be used to specify
the name of the desired cache factory defined in the ejb3 subsystem. If no "@Cache" annotation (resp. deployment descriptor
configuration) is present, a suitable default cache will be used for the bean.

=== Importing Existing Configuration

As mentioned in the section Backwards Compatability, legacy configurations for the _ejb3_ subsystem will still work
(and with the same semantics) with a server incorporating this RFE, and the _distributable-ejb_ subsystem need not be
present in such a case.

Concerning the migration of legacy _ejb3_ subsystem configurations, although legacy configurations will still work,
it is recommended that the legacy configurations be adjusted to use the new _ejb3_ subsystem schema and the
_distributable-ejb_ subsystem, to take advantage of the ability, for example, to plugin different bean management
providers. The adjustments required were described in the section on Backward Compatability.

=== Deployments

A new deployment configuration namespace, specified via jboss-all.xml or a separate distributable-ejb.xml, will be introduced
to permit specifying default providers for bean management (resp. client-mappings management) on a per-deployment basis.
This means that named, configured providers for bean management (resp. client-mappings registry management) may be specified in
several places:

* in the _distributable-ejb_ subsystem, providing server-wide default provider values
* in the distributable-ejb.xml file included with a deployment, providing deployment-scoped default provider values

However, these deployment-specific configurations are planned but out of scope for this current RFE and will be included
in a subsequent RFE.

=== Interoperability

== Implementation Plan

As mentioned in the overview, the _distributable-ejb_ subsystem will eventually support the provision of providers for four
key areas of _ejb3_ subsystem functionality. However, this issue will be restricted to the following scope:

* defining the _distributable-ejb_ subsystem itself
* defining a cache factory provider for stateful session beans and integrating that provider into the _ejb3_ subsystem
* defining a client mappings registry provider for the EJB client and integrating that provider into the _ejb3_ subsystem

The remaining two features will be completed in the separate RFEs mentioned above.

== Security Considerations

None

== Test Plan

The following areas of testing will be required:

* integration of the _ejb3_ subsystem and the _distributable-ejb_ subsystem
** verifying that beans do end up with their specified providers (default case, custom case) when specified via the _ejb3_ subsystem
** verifying that beans do end up with their specified providers (default case, custom case) when specified via the distributable-ejb.xml file
* interoperation of the relevant legacy _ejb3_ subsystem elements and the new subsystem

Since this RFE will change the default configuration for both the basic and HA profiles, the integration between the _ejb3_
subsystem and the new _distributable-ejb_ subsystem will be inherently validated by all existing EJB tests in the WF
basic  and clustering integration testsuites.
A new test will be added to validate that the legacy configuration (i.e.from WF26 or earlier, where the _distributable-ejb_
subsystem is not present) still works. This will reside in the clustering integration testsuite.

== Community Documentation

Documentation is required in order to explain how the subsystem can be used to define and configure clustering-related
backend implementations for features provided by the _ejb3_ subsystem, such as SFSB session caches and EJB client-related client
mappings registries.

== Release Note Content

The _distributable-ejb_ subsystem permits defining named, configured providers for key functionalities of the _ejb3_ subsystem
in clustered scenarios; functionalities such as SFSB cache factories, client mappings registries for EJB client applications,
singleton providers for singleton MDBs, and distributed EJB timers. These providers may then be referenced on a per-deployment or
system-wide basis, permitting the user to tailor such implementations to desired use cases.
