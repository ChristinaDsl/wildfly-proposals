== Overview

Users of singleton deployments and singleton services have long requested for an easy way to determine the primary provider of a given deployment or service.
Currently, this can only be determined by looking at the logs.
This feature request would make this information available from the management model.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

Expose a runtime resource within the singleton subsystem for each singleton deployment/service created from a given singleton policy exposing the following information:

* The name of the cluster member currently acting as the singleton provider

e.g.

----
/subsystem=singleton/singleton-policy=foo/deployment=bar.ear:read-attribute(name=primary-provider)
/subsystem=singleton/singleton-policy=foo/service=org.my.singleton.service.name:read-attribute(name=primary-provider)
----

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

Additionally expose the following:

* The names of the nodes on which the given singleton deployment/service is installed.

e.g.

----
/subsystem=singleton/singleton-policy=foo/deployment=bar.ear:read-attribute(name=providers)
/subsystem=singleton/singleton-policy=foo/service=org.my.singleton.service.name:read-attribute(name=providers)
----

=== Non-Requirements

Users can additionally create singleton services from a SingletonServiceConfiguratorFactory (installed per cache).
As these are not directly managed by the singleton subsystem, singleton services created via this mechanism will not be exposed by the management model.

//== Implementation Plan

== Test Plan

This feature will be tested within the scope of the current clustering testsuite.
We currently have tests that query a servlet to determine the primary provider of a given singleton service.
These tests will be modified to obtain this information via a management client.

== Community Documentation

The community documentation will be updated to include CLI commands for obtaining metrics about a specific singleton deployment or service.
