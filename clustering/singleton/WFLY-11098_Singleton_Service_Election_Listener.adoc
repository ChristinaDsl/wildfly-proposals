== Overview

The MSC includes a listener facility to inform a listener when a given service starts and stops.
For singleton services, we need similar facility - to inform a listener, not just when its service starts and stops, but also which cluster member was elected as the new primary provider.
Users will register this listener when the service is installed.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Public SingletonElectionListener interface with the following method
** void elected(List<Node> candidateMembers, Node electedMember);
* Add listener registration method to public SingletonPolicy interface
* Following an election, the listener callback should be invoked on every cluster member on which the given singleton service was installed
* When run from a non-ha profile, the election listener will be invoked exactly once, as soon as the the service starts.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

* Since listener will be registered during installation, there is no need to support multiple listeners.
  This can be easily simulated via a composite/aggregate listener.

== Test Plan

A new test will be added to the clustering integration testsuite to validate behavior (both ha and local).

== Community Documentation

Community docs will be enhanced to describe listener registration with examples.
