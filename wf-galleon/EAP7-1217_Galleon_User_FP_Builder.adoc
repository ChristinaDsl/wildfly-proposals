== Overview

Offer the ability to package WildFly server customization content as Galleon feature-pack. 
These feature-packs would then be installed on top of WildFly server Galleon installation. 
One of the main use cases is cloud image building:

* Internally, when building our own image, custom content could have been packaged as feature-packs and installed.

* Externally, user can package content (eg: JDBC drivers) as galleon feature-pack and reference feature-packs from their provisioning file.

== Requirements

In order to address this requirement, we are defining a new WildFly Maven plugin (_org.wildfly.galleon-plugins:wildfly-galleon-maven-plugin_)
goal named _build-user-feature-pack_.
This goal handles part of the complexity one would be faced when building a feature-pack for WildFly. 
With minimal configuration, a user should be able to package his content into a WildFly compliant feature-pack.

=== Possible usages inside an S2I context

* Pre-built and already deployed custom feature-packs would be installed like WildFly (galleon install or provision).
* The application src project could include a well-known directory (eg: _wildfly-feature-pack_) that would be recognized by WidlFly S2I. This
directory would contain feature-pack(s) to build and install during application build process. 
Calling _mvn clean install_ in this directory would build the feature-pack(s) and install it(them) into the local maven repository. 
Ready to be provisioned by Galleon in a next step.

=== Supported Galleon content
Content present in user feature-packs is a subset of what Galleon defines. We are reducing the support to:

* Ability to define JBoss Module modules. Modules are recognized by the plugin, 
translated onto Galleon _packages_ and ready to be installed into 
the right location. NB: Custom modules are installed directly under <wildfly-home>/modules/ dir.
Custom modules will benefit from _thin-server_ and _fat-server_ Galleon installation capability. 
Furthermore, the content of module.xml is traversed
and guarantee is made that all non optional dependencies are installed with the custom module.
* Ability to define _package_. Packages contain content to be installed inside a given location. 
Package will benefit from tasks execution.
* Ability to define _layer_. Layers are an interesting way to define re-usable content (eg: jdbc driver).
* Ability to define _configuration_. Configurations are expected to contain piece of 
configuration (eg: datasource, ...) to be combined with WildFly
server configuration.

=== Defining the content
The following layout is expected in the resources dir (dir location configurable):

* _configs_/<model>/<name>/config.xml
* _layers_/<config model>/<name>/layer-spec.xml
* _modules_/<module path>/main/module.xml (and any needed resources)
* _packages_/<name>/package.xml +
_packages_/<name>/[content/<content> | pm/wildfly/tasks.xml]

=== Feature-pack configuration

==== File based configuration
If a file named _wildfly-user-feature-pack-build.xml_ is present in the project root dir (file 
name and dir location configurable), it is used as the source of configuration. This file has the same content
as _wildfly-feature-pack-build.xml_ (file used to build WildFly feature-pack).

The following items are recognized:

* Built feature-pack FPL (Feature Pack Location).
* Dependencies on other feature-packs.
* Default packages.

Because configuration can be seen in some cases as over-complex and error-prone, 
we propose to generate a default configuration when no configuration file is present.

==== Default configuration

===== Default FPL
When no configuration file is provided, the fpl can be provided as a plugin configuration item, 
by default: _${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version}_

===== Default dependencies on WildFly feature-packs
When no configuration file is provided, the following logic applies.

We expect that WildFly Galleon pack artifact will be present as a dependency of 
the current project. NB: It could be interesting to have
WildFly galleon FP as well as this plugin present in BOM file.
All feature-packs (that have an artifactId that complies with wildfl-*galleon-pack_ naming) 
that are direct dependencies of the plugin are added as FP dependencies. 
All feature-packs (that have an artifactId that complies with wildfl-*galleon-pack_ naming) 
that are transitive dependencies of the project are added as transitive FP dependencies. 
Transitive dependencies are needed in order to allow to reference any (core, servlet and full) 
modules in user defined modules.

NB: The WildFly feature-pack _groupId_ is not taken into account when searching for dependencies. 
This should allow to accept WildFly or EAP feature-packs as dependencies. 
This doesn't mean that a feature-pack built for WildFly will be compatible with EAP, WildFly and EAP are 2 different feature-packs.

==== User defined modules resources

A user as the ability to package the module resources (eg: jar file) in multiple ways:

* References the resource maven artifact with hard coded version. For example: _artifact name="mysql:mysql-connector-java:78.0"_
* References the resource maven artifact without version. In this case, the maven artifact must be a dependency of the 
maven project. Artifact version being retrieved from maven. In this case, use the following syntax: _artifact name="${<groupId>:<artifactId>}"_
for example _artifact name="${mysql:mysql-connector-java}"_
* Package the binaries in the feature-pack, adding the jar files as content.

===== Default packages
Default packages must be explicitly added to the build xml file. 

=== A note on defining custom layers
When Galleon CLI install layers (or in general when using _passive_ and _passive+_ options), 
the default packages are not installed. 
Only the packages referenced directly or indirectly from the configuration are installed.
A user defined module is not referenced by WildFly features so would be not provisioned. 
In order to ensure that a package is provisioned
along with a user-defined layer, it must be referenced from the user-defined layer 
(eg: similar to what we do for WildFly h2-database layer).

=== Maven installation

This plugin installs the feature-pack(s) into the local maven repository.

=== Plugin configuration items
A set of values can be provided from the plugin configuration:

* configFile : The feature-pack build configuration file name. Default: _wildfly-user-feature-pack-build.xml_
* configDir: The feature-pack build configuration file directory. Default: _${basedir}_
* resourcesDir: The directory containing resource directories (configs, packages, modules, layers). 
Either an absolute path or a path relative to _configDir_. Default:_src/main/resources_
* buildName: The directory for the built artifact. Default:_${project.build.directory}_
* fpLocation: The FPL for the generated feature-pack. Default: _${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version}_

=== Hard Requirements

* Build feature-packs to be installed on top of WildFly installation provisioned with Galleon.
* Allow users to define JBoss Module modules packages, packages, layers and configs.
* Install feature-pack zip artifact in local maven repository.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Feature-spec generation. Although custom subsystem packaged as feature-pack is a topic outside on this RFE,
this plugin should not forbid such evolution.

=== Non-Requirements

== Implementation Plan

* Refactor WildFly Maven plugin used to build WildFly feature-packs 
(Extract abstract class and expose util methods).
* Base the Maven plugin to build user content on top of the refactoring.

== Test Plan
