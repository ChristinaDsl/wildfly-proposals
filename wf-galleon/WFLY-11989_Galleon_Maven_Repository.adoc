== Requirements

In order to address this requirement, we are defining a new WildFly Maven plugin (_org.wildfly.galleon-plugins:wildfly-galleon-maven-plugin_)
goal named _generate-all-artifacts-list_.
This goal aggregates all offliner files that have been generated when each Wildfly galleon feature-pack is built.

offliner file == list of artifacts == "sha-256 checksum, artifact path inside maven repo" per line.

When building the wildfly-dist module with release profile (-Drelease=true), this plugin is called to 
generate /target/wildfly-galleon-${project.version}-all-artifacts-list.txt directory.

The file is deployed with other maven artifacts as wildfly-dist-${project.version}-artifact-list.txt

Then the workflow to produce a maven repository to provision WildFly is:

1) Retrieve the org.wildfly:wildfly-dist-${project.version}-artifact-list.txt from maven repository

2) Use offliner runtime (https://github.com/release-engineering/offliner) to download all files to populate a local maven repository.

=== Hard Requirements

* Generate and deploy the file with valid sha-256 checksum and paths for all required artifacts.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Implementation Plan

* Add the goal to WildFly galleon-plugins project.
* Evolve dist/pom.xml to call the plugin.

== Test Plan

* Use the generated file to populate a maven local repo.
* Test that wildfly can be provisioned from the resulting repo.
