== Overview

The output paging is not desired in some cases e.g. when copy/pasting the full output of a command.
The paging could be disabled by a simple option.

=== Workaround
It is currently possible to override the paging of a single command by redirecting the output to /dev/stdout.

==== Example of the workaround:
----
/subsystem=elytron:read-resource-description(recursive=true) > /dev/stdout
----

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements
* Ability to disable output paging via CLI argument e.g.:
----
./jboss-cli.sh --no-paging
----
* Ability to disable output paging using `jboss-cli.xml`
* The options would disable the output paging for all commands / output
* Mention the option in the CLI help

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan
Tests should include:

* Effectiveness of the CLI argument and `jboss-cli.xml` option to disable the paging
* Make sure the paging works when any of the options to disable paging is not used
