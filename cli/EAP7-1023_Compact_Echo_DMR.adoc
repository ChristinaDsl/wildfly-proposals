== Overview

The intent of this feature is to introduce a new option to the echo-dmr command
 in order to display compact (a single line) output. The main use case is the ability, 
in conjunction with json output, to generate content directly consumable by the 
HTTP management REST API.

== Requirements

=== Hard requirements

* echo-dmr should be able to display its output in a single line.
* Applies to both JSON and DMR custom syntax.


== Test Plan

* New test cases to cover completion and execution will be added to WFCORE repository.
* Test cases:
** Completon of --compact option.
** Execution of echo-dmr with --compact option. Check that output is on a single line, 
   check that output is semantically identical to echo-dmr called without --compact option.

== Community Documentation

No Community documentation, the command help is enough.

* New --compact option added to echo-dmr.
