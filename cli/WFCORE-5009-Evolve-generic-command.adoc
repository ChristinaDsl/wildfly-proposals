== Overview

The intent of this feature is to introduce a new option to the CLI command _command_ in order
to create commands for existing resources.

=== Testing By

[x] ENG

=== Affected Projects or Components:

* WildFly Core CLI


== Requirements

=== Hard requirements

* Introduce new --node-child=<path to existing child resource> to the _command_ command.
* When --node-child argument is used,the created command is a 
  command that is assigned to a specific child node instance and which allows 
  to perform any operation available for that instance and/or modify any of its 
  properties.
* The child node must already exist in the management model. It can't
  be added using the created command.

=== Non-Requirements

* Add new resource using the created command.

== Test Plan

New test cases to cover completion and execution will be added to WFCORE repository.

* Test that completion of the "command" command proposes new "--node-child" option.
 * Test that completion of the "command" command containing "--node-child" option is aligned with CLI general completion rules.
 * Test that completion of created commands with the new option "--node-child" contains resource's attribute names and doesn't contain "add" operation.
 * Test that add and remove actions for existing resources succeeds.
 * Test that the creation of a command for a non existing child resource fails.
 * Test that the creation of a command for a resource type fails.
 * Test that writing multiple resource attributes using a created command succeeds.

== Community Documentation

No community doc exists for the "command" command, CLI help is the documentation.
