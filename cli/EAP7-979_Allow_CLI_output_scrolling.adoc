== Overview

Since https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-426[WFCORE-426] and https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EAP7-735[EAP7-735]
mouse scrolling is forbidden to large CLI out and user has to press Down or Enter to navigate.
After pressing Down or Enter to display more output, user can not go up by pressing Up.
Therefore, it would be convenient to allow CLI output scrolling by mouse and by Up/Down and PgUp/PgDown keys.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements
* Fast scrolling using PgUp / PgDn. (ATM there is possibility to use space for fast scroll down)
* Scrolling by mouse
* Ability to scroll up
* Since as mentioned in https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/CLI-PagingLongCLIOutput#comment-16541
  the "less" behaviour would result in buffer alternation and therefore after
  exiting the reading of output the output wouldn't be visible any more in the main buffer of the CLI.
  This is not convenient since users may want to see at least part of the output
  in the main buffer.
  Therefore I would propose to print a part of the output from start to the last scrolled position
  into the main buffer of the CLI
  when exiting the more/less reading.


==== List of keys and actions:
Composed keys are unstable during the testing
(this is tracked in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-3545[WFCORE-3545])
Therefore I propose to use for every action a noncomposed key as well.
This will enable us to create a stable tests.

* PGDOWN / SPACE : scroll one page down
* PGUP / BACKSLASH : scroll one page up
* UP / SEMI_COLON: scroll one line up
* DOWN / ENTER / CTRL_M : scroll one line down
* Mouse scroll up : scroll up
* Mouse scroll down : scroll down
* ESC / 'q' / CTRL_C : quit
* HOME / 'g' : go to start of the document
* END / 'G' : go to end of the document

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements


=== Non-Requirements

== Limitations

* On Windows, this feature is only available starting with Windows 10. There are some terminal limitations that make
ANSI alternate buffer not usable.

== Test Plan
I propose to extend
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/blob/master/testsuite/standalone/src/test/java/org/jboss/as/test/integration/management/cli/MoreTestCase.java[MoreTestCase.java]
with following test scenario:

1. Start console and run command ":read-resource"
2. Save the last before last line of output in variable (last line will be the %More string)
3. Move output one line down
.. Send ENTER to the console
.. Check if the output was moved down by one line
4. Move output one line up
.. Send SEMI_COLON to the console
.. Check if the line is the same as the saved one from step 2.
5. Move output one page down
.. Send SPACE to the console
.. Check if the output was moved down by one page (terminal height)
6. Move output one page up
.. Send BACKSLASH to the console
.. Check if the before last line is the same as the saved one from step 1. (last line will be the %More string)
7. Send 'q' to the console
8. Repeat step 1.
9. Send ESC to the console
.. Check if the main buffer contains part of the output from start to the last scrolled position
