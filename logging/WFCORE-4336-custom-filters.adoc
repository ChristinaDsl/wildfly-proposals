== Overview

Currently logging filters are limited to the filters provided by the JBoss Log Manager. Allowing users to create their
own filters will allow for a higher degree of control over logging. As an example a filter could be created to filter
messages based on the cause of the log message.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-4336[WFCORE-4336]

=== Related Issues

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EAP7-1199[EAP7-1199]

=== Dev Contacts

* mailto:{email}[{author}]

=== QE Contacts

* TBD

=== Testing By

* [x] Engineering

* [ ] QE

=== Affected Projects or Components

* WildFly Core
* WildFly

=== Other Interested Projects

* Any consumer of WildFly Core that uses the logging subsystem.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* The resource will require a module name and class name.
* The class must be of type `java.util.logging.Filter`.
* There should be a set of properties which can be set.
  ** The properties should also support whether or not they are construction properties. This may or may not be a
     separate resource and will be determined at implementation time.
* Filters will only be usable on the `filter-spec` attribute.
* Filters should be alowed to be added to an already existing `filter-spec`. For example
  `any(match(".\*example.*"), my-filter-name)`.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

* This will not add any new filters.

== Implementation Plan

This will essentially be a copy of the `custom-formatter`. The name should just be `filter` since no other resources in
the logging subsystem have this name.

== Test Plan

The test plan will simply be unit and integration tests.

== Community Documentation

Documentation will be updated to add documentation and examples of adding ``filter``'s. The filter documentation
will also be updated to show how a filter can be used.
