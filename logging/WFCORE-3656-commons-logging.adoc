== Overview

Current we use https://github.com/jboss-logging/commons-logging-jboss-logmanager[`org.jboss.logmanager:commons-logging-jboss-logmanager`]
for the Apache Commons Logging implementation. This causes issues with the embedded server API's as there is np
requirement that the JBoss Log Manager is the log manager.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

* https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFCORE-3656[WFCORE-3656]

=== Dev Contacts

* mailto:{email}[{author}]

=== QE Contacts

* mailto:nziakova@redhat.com[Nikoleta Ziakova]

=== Affected Projects or Components

* WildFly Core
* WildFly
* Any projects based on WildFly
* New provisioning

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Support the same `LogFactory` methods we currently support in `org.jboss.logmanager:commons-logging-jboss-logmanager`
* Commons Logging should work with per-deployment logging and logging profiles

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

* Not all methods of the `LogFactory` API will be supported.

== Test Plan

New tests will be in the PR that will test all supported logging API's with logging profiles. This should cover test
that the new Apache Commons Logging implementation works.
