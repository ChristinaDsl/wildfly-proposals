== Overview
Pushing log messages to a centralized log collector/server seems to be a more common practice, especially with
microservices. This can currently be done with a syslog-handler. However new collectors like fluentd or logstash accept
JSON formatted logs. Having the ability format log messages in JSON will be a requirement in order to support newer log
collectors.

This will also be used in OpenShift as it currently uses an alpha version of the
`org.jboss.logmanager:jboss-logmanager-ext` which is not meant to be consumed. Adding first class support for JSON
formatting will allow OpenShift to not have to install a custom module and use standard configurations.

Note that while XML may not be a requirement it may be useful to have and is essentially free since it's not much
different than the JSON formatter implementation.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* A log record must be well formatted in JSON or XML.
* There should be the ability to define if a stack trace is formatted as a complex object or a simple string.
* The ability to add various metadata should be to the formatted message should also be available.
    ** This is useful in situations where a log collector might require a special key/value pair. For example the
     @version=1 in logstash.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* Having the ability to override they keys/element names used when formatting the log record.

=== Non-Requirements

* The ability to write valid JSON or XML documents. What this means is if a JSON or XML formatter is used to write to a
file, that file will not be well formed data. A separate handler would need to be created to ensure a full document is
well formatted.

== Test Plan

Standard unit and integration tests will be used.
