== Overview

Centralized logging is becoming a more common infrastructure decision and is often on a remote server. Adding a
`socket-handler` resource to the logging subsystem will allow log messages to be sent to a remote server.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* Messages should be able to be sent over the following protocols:
    ** TCP
    ** SSL/TLS TCP
    ** UDP
* The logging subsystem will not manage the connected sockets. It will be required to use an `outbound-socket-binding`
  for the creation of sockets.
* The `org.jboss.logmanager.handlers.SocketHandler` will be wrapped in a `org.jboss.logmanager.handlers.DelayedHandler`.
  This is done as the socket binding will not be available at boot when the `logging.properties` is used.
  ** It will need to be noted/documented that using a `DelayedHandler` queues messages, then once activated replays the
     messages. If `TRACE` or `DEBUG` messages are enabled this could make the queue rather large and eventually hit a
     OOME. Once the logging subsystem is initialized, this behavior goes away. However for `--admin-only` containers
     testing will need to be done to ensure the queue does not endlessly grow.
* Not all attributes common to other handlers will be required. For example the `formatter` attribute will not be
  available on the resource making the `named-formatter` a required attribute for this resource.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

* Messages will not be guaranteed to be sent. There could be cases where a network connection is closed or an error
  occurs transporting the error.
* Servers launched in `admin-only` will not log messages over a socket. Runtime services are required for this handler
  to work. It's not currently possible for it to work in admin-only. Messages will just be discarded.

== Implementation Plan

The logging subsystem will need to introduce a service to allow the `org.wildfly.network.outbound-socket-binding` and
`org.wildfly.management.socket-binding-manager` capabilities to be used. The `org.wildfly.network.outbound-socket-binding`
capability is on-demand which makes a service required.

This also means the `org.wildfly.logging.handler` capability will require a service type of `java.util.logging.Handler`.
However it will not be a requirement for all capability points have a service. As a result the service type will not be
documented in the capability reference.

== Test Plan

Currently the log manager has test for the socket handler. Similar tests will be added to WildFly Core tests. A simple
echo style server will need to be used.
