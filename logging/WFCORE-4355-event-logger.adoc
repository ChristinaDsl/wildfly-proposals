== Overview

There are open feature requests to add the ability to write audit and access logs to `stdout` in a JSON format. It would
useful to have a common API which could be used to write this data.

== Issue Metadata

=== Issue

=== QE Contacts

For this specific case there will not be a QE contact as each individual JIRA will have an associated QE contact and
it's that data that needs to be validated.

=== Testing By

* [x] Engineering

* [ ] QE

=== Affected Projects or Components

=== Other Interested Projects

* WildFly Core management audit logging
* Elytron security audit logging
* WildFly EJB access logging
* Undertow (in WildFly subsystem) access logging

NOTE: | There is not currently a requirement for these projects to use this API. It's only purpose is to make it easy
to write JSON to `stdout`.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* This should be a fairly simple API. We don't want to re-implement a full log manager.
* The initial implementation should allow for asynchronous writes.
* The output should default to JSON.
* The output should be written to `stdout` by default.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

* It may be helpful to have a writer that writes to a file which can handle rotation of the file.

=== Non-Requirements

* This will not be a full log manager. There is no current intent to allow filtering messages.

== Implementation Plan

== Test Plan

The test plan will simply be unit tests.

== Community Documentation

In this specific case there will not be any community documentation. This is not meant to be a public API at this point.
