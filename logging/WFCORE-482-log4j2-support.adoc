== Overview

As log4j2 has risen in popularity and suggested as a replacement for log4j. There have been many requests to have support
in WildFly for log4j2. With this feature users will be able to use the log4j2 API which will delegate to the JBoss Log
Manager.

NOTE: | This will be an implementation of the log4j2 API only. The core log manager for log4j2 will *not* be supported.

=== Affected Projects or Components

=== Other Interested Projects

* Any consumer of WildFly Core that uses the logging subsystem.

== Requirements

=== Hard Requirements

* A user can use a log4j2 logger, `org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger`, which will pass the log message to the JBoss Log
  Manager which is the log manager WildFly uses.
* The log4j-api will be added to all deployments by default.
* The log4j2 loggers created should honor the JBoss Log Manager's log context associated with the deployment.
** This means if the deployment includes a logging configuration for a supported log manager the logger created should
   honor that log context.
* The `ThreadContext.getContext()` will be copied to `MDC` in for the log record.
* The `ThreadContext.getImmutableStack()` will be treated as `NDC` and formatted as such for the log record.

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

* Usage of any `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` API's or implementations will not be supported. In other words
  the log4j2 log manager implementation, including configuration files, will not be supported.

== Implementation Plan

This will be provided by a separate community project which implements the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api`. It
should be clear the implementation only implements the API. Calls to the API will delegate to the JBoss Log Manager.

There may be limitations, such as `Marker` support, that will not be implemented. This is due to the fact that the JBoss
Log Manager itself does not have a marker API.

== Test Plan

Integration tests will be provided in WildFly Core. There may also be need to have some integration tests in WildFly
if something other than a JAR deployment needs to be tested.

== Community Documentation

By default, the `org.apache.logging.log4j.api` module, and the `org.jboss.logmanager.log4j2-jboss-logmanager` module
will be added to deployments. These can be excluded via a `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` or by setting the
`add-logging-api-dependencies` attribute value to `false`. Note though that attribute value will affect all deployments.
